Title=Can not play MIDI's?

<ul>
  <li>You must have a sound card (speakers...)  The quality of the sound card
(e.g., wave tables verses synthesized) may dramatically effect the sounds produced by these
routines.<BR><BR>

  <li> Getting the browser to play MIDI's is usually fairly easy. You need software installed to play
MIDI's.  Windows media player seems quite fickle and worse, Mircosoft Explorer 
<a href="http://ppewww.ph.gla.ac.uk/~flavell/www/content-type.html">improperly ignores</a> HTTP Content-Type 
headers.  Under Windows you might try the debug options which will give a link to the output <BR><BR>

  <li>If your player repeats the MIDI over and over, check to see it has an option you can set to stop
looping.<BR><BR>

  <li>If the server response time is too slow (page takes too long to load and the MIDI device times
out), check the "debug" checkbox and use the link on the debug page.<BR><BR>

</ul>
