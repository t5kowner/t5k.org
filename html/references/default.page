This is a collection of the references used by the local <A
href="/">Prime Pages</A> (plus a few related
entries).&nbsp;  It is not an attempt at a complete bibliography for
primes.

<P>If you are just beginning to read books on number theory and prime
numbers, then I would suggest you start with a good elementary number
theory text, followed by <A
href="refs.cgi?long=Ribenboim95">Ribenboim95</A>.&nbsp; For those 
with a solid mathematical background there is the excellent text 
on the state of the art by Crandall and Pomerance <a 
href="refs.cgi?long=CP2001">CP2001</A>.&nbsp;

If you wish a start at programming some of these algorithms see <A
href="refs.cgi?long=Riesel94">Riesel94</A> (and perhaps <A
href="refs.cgi?long=Bressoud89">Bressoud89</A> and <A
href="refs.cgi?long=Knuth97">Knuth97</A>).&nbsp;

If you have a solid foundation in number theory, and are looking for
theoretical information on algorithms (with an excellent summary of recent
research), see the impressive text <A
href="refs.cgi?long=BS96">BS96</A>.&nbsp;

For a more historical prospective, consider <a
href="refs.cgi?long=Williams98">Williams98</a> These last two texts, as well
as those by Ribenboim and Riesel (above)  have <i>extensive</i>
reference lists.&nbsp; 

<P>Please <a href="mailto:admin@t5k.org">send us</a> any corrections and
suggested additions (hopefully in BibTeX format).
