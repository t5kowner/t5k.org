<h3>Why allow comments?</h3>

The purpose of the database is to encourage the sharing of information about prime numbers.&nbsp;  Often the large 
primes are found for special purposes or using special techniques.&nbsp;  The comments should support this 
mission.&nbsp; 

<a name="what"></a>
<h3>Guidelines for comments:</h3>

We would like to see:
<ol>
 <li>Proof information for primes this site has not yet verified (usually because the proof technique is long or 
involved).
 <li>Comments that explain why a prime is *mathematically* interesting (e.g., "this is the eighth prime found by the 
Seventeen or Bust project in its effort to prove the Sierpinski conjecture" with appropriate links).
</ol>

We created the comments to allow:
<ol>
  <li>Properties of primes that are not archivable yet still have mathematical merit.  For example, we have deemed 
a very short list of Generalized Fermat divisibility properties archivable.  You might list other small bases for which 
there is divisibility.
</ol>
But this is <b>not</b> a place for <a href="/curios">Prime Curios!</a>, we have an entire database for those.

<p>We would like to avoid:
<ol>
 <li>Silly names attached to primes: "Caldwell prime of the second kind"
</ol>

We will remove (and possible block posters from writing future comments):
<ol>
 <li>Messages between users, attacks, complements, congratulations...&nbsp;  This is an informational
     database, not a bulletin board.
 <li>Incorrect comments.
 <li>Improper or foul language--this site should be appropriate for learners of all ages!
 <li>Distracting or annoying HTML code.
</ol>
So always use common sense and just post what would be acceptable to the 
mathematical community.

<h3>Who can comment</h3>

Currently commenting is limited to those provers in the database that have at least one prime, and who have not yet 
lost the privilege to post comments.&nbsp;

<h3>Final note</h3>

User comments are an experimental feature of this database and these rules and conditions are all subject to change at
anytime without notice.&nbsp;
