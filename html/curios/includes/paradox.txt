A Curious Paradox
   
  
 
  <P>Is that truly possible?&nbsp; Can <a
href=../first.php#theorem> every positive integer have an
associated Prime Curio</a>?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; If we list
everything that any one person (perhaps yourself?) found
interesting about primes, it would be a finite list, because we
are finite (we can do a finite number of things at once and
live for a finite period of time).&nbsp; Yes, we can write an
algorithm for assigning "curious" properties to integers, but
using an algorithm would defeat the intent of our definition of
curios.&nbsp; Since the number of humans is finite, it follows
then that the number of curios must also be finite -- but the
set of integers is infinite!

  <P>Our proof that every integer has an associated Prime Curio
is what is called a semantical paradox.&nbsp; Perhaps the
oldest of these is from Epimenides the Cretan who said that:

<blockquote>
  All Cretans were liars and all other statements made by Cretans were certainly
lies.
</blockquote>

  Here is a simpler form of this paradox: suppose I say "I am
lying."&nbsp; If I am lying when I say this, then I am telling the
truth; and if I am telling the truth when I say it, then I am
lying.&nbsp; Epimenides probably lived in the fifth or sixth
century BC and is most likely the philosopher referred to by
the Apostle Paul in Titus 1:12.&nbsp; The stories of
Epimenides' life are so fanciful (e.g., that he lived for
hundreds of years and once slept for 57 years) that little is
truly known about him.

  <P>Our proof is actually a version of a more recent
semantical paradox sent by G. G. Berry of the
Bodleian Library to Bertrand Russell in a letter dated 21
December 1904.&nbsp; (This letter is reprinted in
[Garciadiego92].)&nbsp; You will often find Berry's paradox stated
as "every integer is interesting."&nbsp; If you reread our proof,
you will be able to reconstruct the "proof" of Berry's paradox.

  <P>Berry is also credited with the invention of the greeting
card paradox--he would introduce himself with a card that on
one side said:

<blockquote>
  The statement on the other side of this card is false.
</blockquote>

and on the other said:

<blockquote>
  The statement on the other side of this card is true.
</blockquote>

If you think through these statements, then you will see we
have another version of the Epimenides paradox: if either of
the statements are true, then they must be false as well.

<P>A slightly later version of these paradoxes is Richard's
paradox (1906).&nbsp; His paradox can be stated in the form:

<blockquote>
  Every positive integer can be uniquely defined using at most
100 keystrokes on a typewriter.&nbsp; 
</blockquote>

To "prove" this statement you create the type of paradox above
by considering the set S of all integers that cannot be so
described.&nbsp; By the well ordering principal this set has a
least member, and is in fact:

<blockquote>
  The least positive integer that cannot be described in at
most 100 keystrokes.
</blockquote>

But of course we just described it uniquely using less that 100
keystrokes, so to avoid a contradiction the set S must be
empty!&nbsp; Yet, we can also easily disprove this statement because
a typewriter has less that 200 keys (probably closer to 100),
and it follows that 100 keystrokes can describe less than
200100 integers, so Richard's paradox cannot be true.

<P>Russell discussed each of these paradoxes (and several more)
in his "Mathematical logic as based on the theory of types
[Russell1908] (reprinted in [Heijenoort67]) and concludes that
they do not affect the logical calculus which is incapable of
expressing their character.</p>

<P>Again, these are semantical paradoxes unlike Russell's
famous paradox of the set of all sets that do not contain
themselves.&nbsp; This paradox is often recast as a question
about a barber:</p>

<blockquote>
If there is a town in which the barber shaves (exactly) those
who do not shave themselves, then does the barber shave
himself? 
</blockquote>

If he does shave himself, then he does not; and if he does not,
then he does.
