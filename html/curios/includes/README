These are support files for this collection

  mail.php	(specific to collection) allows mailing the editors

  file.php	(generic) allows txt files to be printed in the template
		and allows editing over the internet.  The *.txt files must
		be world readable/writable to edit.  Should also be linked
		from the test version to the actual for backups to work right.
		Note that we use *.html in the url and translated it to *.txt
		(lynx needs the .html extension, I wanted .txt locally to
		keeps these files separate from the rest!)
