  <p>So who are the submitters whose names appear in brackets at the end of many entries?  They are usually the submitters: the person(s) who submitted the entry.  On 
occasion, the submitter uses the name of a discoverer, rather than give themselves credit for submitting.  Also, submitters find the curios themselves, so in these 
cases the submitters are also the discoverer.</p>  

<p>The goal of this site is to catalog interesting facts about primes as a list of short pithy statements.  It is not to provide reference to the vast lituratue that 
can be found behind many of the curios.  We incourage submitters to use web references to sources or explanatory pages, our collection is just not designed to provide 
that background. We are also unable to arbitrate between different parties who both claim to have first found a result.</p>

<p>This is very common among trivia collections, to provide the trivia, period.  So in short the submmitters in brackets are just that, submitters.</p>
