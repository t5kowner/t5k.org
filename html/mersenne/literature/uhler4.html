   What are Mersenne numbers and why should any television fan abandon
   this latest relaxation fad for neglecting the proper maintenance of
   muscular tissue in order to consume any mental energy on something
   as ancient, trite, and obvious as any kind of number? We shall
   endeavor to give a succinct answer to the first part of this question
   while abandoning the second part to the anthropologist, to the student
   of the completely unreliable mammal often questionably referred to as
   &quot;homo sapiens.&quot;

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   It is convenient to call any number expressed by the form <I>Mp</I> = 2^<I>p</I>-1,
   where <I>p</I> denotes a prime number, a Mersenne number regardless of the
   fact that this philosopher extended his prediction only as far as
   <I>p</I> = 257.

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   When[<a href="#ref_01">1</a>] did Marin Mersenne live? He was born near Oiz&eacute; (Sarthe) on
   Sept. 8, 1588, and died in Paris on Sept. 1, 1648. Mersenne and
   Descartes were fellow students at the Jesuit college of La Fl&egrave;che.
   In 1611 Mersenne joined the Minim Friars, and in 1620 he made
   permanent residence in Paris at the convent of L'Annonciade. The
   Minimi[<a href="#ref_02">2</a>] (or Minims) were members of a Roman Catholic monastic order
   founded in Italy in 1435 by St. Francis of Paula. This designation
   was assumed as an expression of self-abasement. A portrait of Father
   Mersenne is reproduced on page 72 of Oystein Ore's fascinating text
   entitled <I>Number Theory and Its History</I>, (1948).

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   What interest attaches to integers of the form 2^<I>p</I> - 1, <I>p</I> prime?
   Fundamentally because of their relation to the so-called <I>perfect</I>
   numbers. A number is said to be perfect when it is equal to the sum
   of all its integral divisors not including itself. For example 28 =
   1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 and is &quot;perfect.&quot; Euclid (<I>c</I> 330 B.C.) proved that
   a number satisfying the formulation (2^(<I>p</I>-1))(2^<I>p</I> - 1) is perfect
   when the factor 2^<I>p</I> - 1 is a Mersenne prime. Obviously when the
   number itself is included as its own divisor then the sum of the
   divisors equals twice the perfect integer.

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   In this connection the following quotations are interesting and
   informative. From pages 43 and 44 of Peter Barlow's book entitled
   <I>Theory of Numbers</I> we quote &quot;The difficulty, therefore, of finding
   perfect numbers, arises from that of finding prime numbers, of the
   form 2^<I>n</I> - 1, which is very laborious. Euler ascertained, that
   2^31 - 1 = 2147483647 is a prime number; and this is the greatest at
   present known to be such, and, consequently, the last of the above
   perfect numbers, which depends upon this, is the greatest perfect
   number known at present, and probably the greatest that ever will be
   discovered; for, as they are merely curious without being useful, it
   is not likely that any person will attempt to find one beyond it.
   It may not be amiss to observe, that the reason for employing the
   powers of 2 in this research, to the exclusion of all other numbers,
   arises from this, that 2 is the only even prime; and, therefore, if
   we made use of any other prime, as <I>a</I>, then (<I>a</I>^<I>n</I> - 1) would not be a
   prime number; and, if we employed an even number, then the formula
   above given would not truly express the sum of the divisors of <I>N</I>.&quot;
   Barlow's rather derogatory opinions of the year 1811 are partially
   shared by Edmund Landau.[<a href="#ref_03">3</a>]

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   He says (in German): &quot;This ancient idea
   of the perfect number and its associated questions are not
   especially important, I treat these matters only because by so doing
   we shall immediately encounter two problems which are unsolved even
   to-day: ... [1927]. Is the number of even perfect numbers infite? I
   do not know. Is the number of odd perfect numbers infite? I don't
   even know whether a single odd perfect number exists. Nevertheless
   I beg the reader not to ponder long over these two questions; he or
   she will learn about many more abstruse and promising problems during
   the study of this work.&quot;

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   In marked contrast with the last opinion we read from the pen of
   E. T. Bell:[<a href="#ref_04">4</a>] &quot;This raises the interesting and extremely difficult
   question of finding those primes <I>p</I> which make 2^<I>p</I> - 1 prime. Any
   help here would be appreciated by arithmeticians. For <I>p</I> = 2, 3, 5,
   7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127, it is known that 2^<I>p</I> - 1 is
   prime. Can anything <I>general</I> be stated? If so, whisper it to some
   mathematician and you will probably be heard, from now till at least
   the year 4000 A. D.)&quot;

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Greater human interest in Mersenne numbers developed from his
   apparently off-hand prediction that the only values of <I>p</I> up to, and
   inclusive of, 257 are 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 67, 127, 257.
   Justifiable curiosity led to the investigation by many computers of
   the prime or composite character of the numbers 2^<I>p</I> - 1 for all of
   the 55 primes not exceeding <I>p</I> = 257. Comparison of the predicted
   list with the correct set given in the preceding paragraph shows
   that Mersenne made five mistakes.. He erroneously included <I>p</I> = 67,
   257, and excluded <I>p</I> = 61, 89, 107. Since Mersenne made his
   prediction in the year 1644 and the last one of the 55 candidates
   2^<I>p</I> - 1 was finally examined in the year 1947[<a href="#ref_05">5</a>] it is rather
   astonishing that about 303 years were required to completely set
   Mersenne right! (I wonder what his reactions were, if any.)

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   In critical vein attention may be called to a Special to the <I>New
      York Times</I>, from Chicago, and published on Friday, March 27, 1936.
   We quote: &quot;A problem which has baffled mathematicians since the
   time of Euclid, the finding of a perfect number with more than 19
   digits, has been solved by Dr. Samuel I. Krieger.&quot; The 155-figure
   value of 2^513 - 2^256 is then given correctly. But this equals
   (2^256)(2^257 - 1) in which the <I>M</I>257 factor had been shown to be
   <I>composite</I> by D. H. Lehmer and published in May 1931, nearly five
   years earlier than Dr. Krieger's false claim to prominence. The
   moral relative to the very best of newspapers should be obvious.
   (By the way, the writer has sought in vain to find out the personal
   history of D. Krieger. So haben der Krieger und die Zeitung gar
   nichts &quot;gekriegt.&quot;)

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   An extension of the playground belonging to the perfect numbers is
   afforded by the multiply perfect numbers which are defined as
   having the sum of their divisors equal to a multiple (2, 3, 4, . . . )
   of the number itself. For example 672 = 2^5*3*7 is a number of this
   kind since the sum of its 192 divisors equals 2*672. The multiple
   may be called the <I>class</I> of the number. An enthusiastic amateur has
   sent me (in 1949) one of his numbers of class 8, having 162 digits
   and 13122 97817 86896 62976 divisors, inclusive of 1 and N.

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The reader who desires full details concerning the names of the
   investigators of the prime or composite character of Mersenne
   numbers, of the factors when obtainable, of the dates and journals
   of publication, etc., should refer to the characteristically
   complete and reliable paper by R. C. Archibald in S<font size=-1>CRIPTA</font>
   M<font size=-1>ATHEMATICA</font>, v. 3, No. 2, p. 112-119, April 1935. Since Archibald's
   paper practically exhausts the references up to the last date we
   shall continue the present record after the year 1935.

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   At that time there were six values of <I>p</I> within the Mersenne range
   which had not been investigated. They corresponded to <I>p</I> = 157, 167,
   193, 199, 227, and 229. The work of E. Fauquembergue,[<a href="#ref_06">6</a>] published
   in 1914, established beyond question the primality of 2^127 - 1.
   The interval of 21 years (1935-1914) seemed to give excellent
   promise of a prime among the six virgin Mersenne numbers. These
   considerations so overwhelmed the writer that he entered the arena
   well armed and practiced but wholly ignorant of the strength of the
   enemy. After tremendous labor caused by unreliable desk machines
   and especially by an almost exaggerated estimate of the penalty of
   an error of even one digit in any place, he eventually succeeded in
   proving that all six of the Mersenne numbers are composite. It was
   small consolation to realize that not a single prime occurred in,
   the surprisingly long interval including the 24 prime values of p,
   namely, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191,
   193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, and 257. But
   this is not all, the first sentence of a letter generously sent to
   me by Lehmer and received on March 30, 1952, reads: &quot;You will
   doubtless be interested in the results on the SWAC on the night of
   Jan. 30, namely that 2^521 - 1 and 2^607 - 1 are the next two
   Mersenne primes. Since there are 42 prime <I>p</I>'s between 257 and 521
   the complete gap of composite numbers of the form 2^<I>p</I> - 1 (<I>p</I>-prime)
   comprises 66 values. It was certainly unexpected that 12 prime
   <I>Mp</I>'s should occur in the first 31 values of <I>p</I> while not a single]
   Mersenne prime or perfect number exists in the succeeding range of
   66 prime <I>p</I>'s. (Long live the &quot;Queen and Servant of Science.&quot; E. T.
   B<font size=-1>ELL</font>.)

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Why is it so difficult to test with desk machines a given number of
   the form <I>Mp</I>? This is tantamount to asking precisely what the
   procedure is. A brief outline of the high points of the method may
   not be superfluous. The basic theorem, as perfected by D. H. Lehmer
   from the pioneer results of Lucas, reads: <I>The number Mp</I> = 2^<I>p</I> - 1 <I>is
      a Prime if and only if it divides the</I> (<I>p</I> - 1)-<I>st term of the series
      4, 14, 194, 37634, S</I>[<I>n</I>],...where <I>S</I>[<I>n</I>] = <I>S</I>[<I>n</I>-1]^2 - 2. In non-
   algobraic language we obtain the second element of this series by
   squaring the first term and subtracting 2, i.e., 14 = 4^2 - 2. Next
   we square the second term and subtract 2 to derive the third
   element, i.e., 194 = 14^2 - 2, etc. Lehmer[<a href="#ref_07">7</a>] says: &quot;For numbers of
   the form 2^(4<I>p</I>+-1)-1 Lucas advises the use of the series 3, 7, 47,
   . . . This series does not give a necessary condition for primality,
   while the series 4, 14, 194, . . . gives a necessary and sufficient
   test for both 2^(4<I>p</I>+-1)-1.&quot; An equivalent corollary is this: <I>The
      number 2</I>^<I>p</I>-<I>1 is prime if and only if the </I>(<I>p</I> - 2)-<I>nd term of the
      series 4, 14, 194, equals +-2</I>^((<I>p</I>+1)/2) (<I>modulo p</I>). The point here
   is that on repeated divisions by <I>Mp</I> the remainder for the (<I>p</I> - 1)-st
   term must be zero and the remainder for the preceding division must
   equal numerically 2 with the exponent (<I>p</I> + 1)/2 in order that
   primality of 2^<I>p</I> - 1 shall exist. Obviously (<I>p</I> + 1)/2 will be an
   integer because to be prime and greater than 2, <I>p</I> must be odd, <I>p</I> + 1
   even, and hence (<I>p</I> + 1)/2 integral.

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   An extremely simple numerical illustration should suffice. Consider the
   case where <I>p</I> = 7 and <I>M</I>[7] = 2^7 - 1 = 127. To have a non-zero quotient
   we begin with the third term of the sequence 4, 14, 194, ... Divide 194
   by 127 to obtain the remainder r3 = 67. (Don't bother about the
   quotients.) Square 67 and subtract 2 to get 4487. Divide 4487 by 127
   to produce the remainder <I>r</I>4 = 42. Square 42 and subtract 2 to find 1762.
   Divide this by 127 using the quotient 14 (instead of 13) to produce the
   smaller remainder <I>r</I>5 = -16. This satisfies the corollary -2^((<I>p</I>+1)/2) =
   -2^((7+1)/2) = -2^4 = -16 hence 2^7 - 1 is prime. If we had gone one step
   farther we should have squared 16 and subtracted 2 giving 254. Finally
   division by 127 presents the remainder zero and thus satisifies the
   necessary and sufficient requirement for primality. In this extremely
   simple illustration we might have divided 127 into the fifth member of 4,
   14, 194, ... that is, into 14163 17954 and obtained the remainder +111 or
   111-127 = -16 at one stroke. Or again we may divide 127 into 2005 95654
   68227 46114, which is the sixth term of the series (counting 4 as the first)
   and find the remainder 0 at once. On the other hand this last procedure
   is of no practical value because the higher terms of 4, 14, 194, ...
   increase at a terrific rate[<a href="#ref_08">8</a>]. For illustration, the tenth term contains
   293 digits (roughly 3 X 10^2), the 226th term possesses very roughly
   3 X 10^57 figures, and the 388th term boasts of about 1.8 X 10^116 digits.
   Hence, in now obsolete practice one humbly commenced with the smallest term
   of the series 4, 14, 194, which exceeded the divisor (modulus, modul) <I>Mp</I>.

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Too much emphasis cannot be placed upon the fact that at long last the
   courageous arithmetician has been emancipated forever from the slavery of
   hand computation on Mersenne and analogous numbers by the appearance on
   Earth of the magnificent digital calculating assemblages. And in point of
   time these are still in their infancy. As stated in an earlier paragraph
   the SWAC battery proved on the night of January 30, 1952, that 2^521 - 1
   and 2^607 - 1 are Mersenne primes. Behold <I>M</I>521 = 68 64797 66013 06097
   14981 90079 90813 93217 26943 53001 43305 40939 44634 59185 54318 33976

   12574 02829 11150 57151 and M607 = 531 13799 28167 67098 68958 82065
   52468 62732 95931 17727 03192 31994 44138 20040 35598 60852 24273 91625
   02265 22928 56688 89329 48624 65010 15346 57933 76527 07239 40951 99787
   66587 35194 38312 70835 39321 90317 28127, which PRIMES possess, respectively,
   157 and 183 digits (when written on the base 10). The smallest term of the
   series 4, 14, 194, ... which could be used as a dividend for the divisor just
   written would be the 10th, which comprises 293 figures. Imagine dividing by
   a number 183 digits long 596 or 597 times, squaring the remainders, etc.,
   with a desk machine.

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Finally and for completeness I squared 2^606 and multiplied by 2 to get
   2^1213 with the object of computing the largest perfect number known to man
   at this time. <I>v</I>14 = 2^(<I>p</I>-1)(2^<I>p</I> - 1) = (2^606) (2^607 - 1) = 2^1213 -
   2^606 = 1 41053 78370 67120 69063 20795 80860 63189 88148 67435 14715 66783

   93271 64087 72436 63700 87116 73126 81593 13652 48745 06524 39805 87729

   95373 28128.

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The SWAC digital computer uses the base 16 instead of the radix 10 as may
   be inferred from the fact that the remainders kindly sent to the writer
   by D. H. Lehmer were expressed in terms of 2^4. For example the SWAC gave
   for the last remainder for <I>M</I>227 the value 3<I>z</I> 93458 0<I>w</I>7<I>w</I>0 45028 626<I>z</I>6 58002
   91<I>ux</I>2 4<I>xuw</I>2 28<I>vx</I>7 <I>zv</I>7<I>uy</I> 36<I>yv</I>2
   6<I>y</I>7<I>wy</I> where <I>u</I> == 10, <I>v</I> == 11, <I>w</I> == 12,
   <I>x</I> == 13, <I>y</I> == 14, <I>z</I> == 15. This verifies exactly my (<I>p</I> - l)-th remainder
   as first obtained on June 4, 1947, viz., 1071 24133 67508 18344 33653
   76892 98433 16050 93930 31886 49512 37078 23311 35950. In other words the
   same remainder reads (3)(16)^56 + (15)(16)^55 + (9)(16)^54 + ... + (7)(16)^2
   + (12)(16)^1 + (14)(16)^0, or, if the reader prefers, 3*2^224 + 15*2^220 +
   9*2^216 + ... + 7*2^8 + 12*2^4 + 14*2^0, in the language of the SWAC and
   1*10^69 + 0*10^68 + 7*10^67 + ... + 9*10^2 + 5*10^1 + 0*10^0 in the
   language of the Collector of Internal Revenue.

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The probability that a computer would obtain the (<I>p</I> - 1)-th remainder
   from a series like 4, 14, 194, ... as zero when the Mersenne number was
   actually composite is utterly negligible, although not impossible. On the
   other hand, even with the utmost care and impeccable honesty it would be
   possible (&quot;human&quot;) to obtain an incorrect finite (<I>p</I> - 1)-th remainder with
   the divisor Mp and to claim proof for the composite character of the
   2^<I>p</I> - 1 number under investigation when the number is prime. A case in
   point is that of Charles B. Barker who published a note indicating that he
   had demonstrated the composite nature of <I>M</I>167[<a href="#ref_09">9</a>]. The subsequent discovery
   by D. H. Lehmer of the factor 2349023 for <I>M</I>167 established the facts that
   this number is composite but that Barker's remainder from the Lucasian
   sequence 3, 7, 47, ... was incorrect. In other words Barker's result was
   illusory and he did not really prove anything about 2^167 - 1. Indeed the
   same misfortune might have befallen the present writer for at least one of
   the six then unexamined Mersenne numbers which he investigated and found
   to have finite (<I>p</I> - 1)-th remainders. Hence it was a source of great
   encouragement when the SWAC furnished the data (as of January 1952) which
   completely verified all of his final test remainders. However the
   discovery by Lehmer of the factors 2349023 and 1504073 for <I>M</I>167 and <I>M</I>229,
   respectively, had previously substantiated two of my residues in the year
   1946.

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The only reason for relegating this paragraph to the end of the
   historiette is that it refers chiefly to new prime numbers which are not
   of the Mersenne type. From various sources,[<a href="#ref_10">10</a>] including personal letters
   from England, the following valuable information has been gleaned. A.
   Ferrier proved that (2^148 + 1)/17 is prime. When written out on the base
   ten we find the 44-digit number 2098 89366 57440 58648 61512 64256 61022
   25938 63921. Using the EDSAC, Miller and Wheeler have demonstrated that
   the expression <I>k</I>(2^127 - 1) + 1 generates a prime for each of the following
   eleven values of <I>k</I>, namely, 114, 124, 388, 408, 498, 696, 738, 744, 780,
   934, and 978. For visual reasons I have expanded the prime numbers
   corresponding to the extreme values of <I>k</I>. For <I>k</I> = 114 the result has 41
   digits and reads 1 93960 94914 49349 24174 12352 62361 07880 52879. For
   978*<I>M</I>127 + 1 the decimalized representation 16 63980 77424 33890 86335
   90183 03413 46554 01007 has 42 digits. Finally the M.-W. team can boast
   of the 79-digit prime 180(2^127 - 1)^2 + 1 = 5210 64401 56792 28794 06069
   43253 90955 85333 58984 83908 05645 83521 83851 01837 25557 35221.
   Collecting, we record that of the 1951-52 record-breaking crop of 15
   luscious prime numbers 5 have 41 digits each, 6 have 42 digits each, the
   remaining 4 possess, respectively, 44, 79, 157, 183 digits.

   After the preceding manuscript had been received by the Editor-in-Chief
   of S<font size=-1>CRIPTA</font> M<font size=-1>ATHEMATICA</font> I became aware of the fact that valuable
   information acquired subsequently from various sources concerning the work
   with SWAC should be included in this paper provided that no unprofessional
   duplication be thereby incurred. Hence I wrote to headquarters, that is
   to my friend Professor D. H. Lehmer, Director of Research of the Institute
   for Numerical Analysis, National Bureau of Standards, Los Angeles,
   California. His answering letter was immediate and it contained without
   reservation the following up-to-date minute details, as of June 4, 1952.

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   All Lucas tests that were performed earlier with hand machines have been
   repeated on the SWAC. The machine definitively emphasized Barker's fiasco.
   A few other disagreements will be investigated by Lehmer.

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &quot;The SWAC Mersenne Project consists in testing 2^<I>p</I> - 1 for <I>p</I> &lt; 2309. Each
   test is run twice with agreement, the second run being made at least a
   week after the first. At present writing only two Mersenne primes have
   been found, 2^521 - 1 and 2^607 - 1. The first run has reached <I>p</I> = 2011
   and the second run <I>p</I> = 1307. The test for a given <I>p</I> takes approximately
   (<I>p</I>/100)^3 seconds.&quot;

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &quot;The 'credit' for these results goes to the SWAC.&quot; Personal credit belongs
   to Professor R. M. Robinson of the University of California, at Berkeley,
   who designed this program.

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   As to prime factoring the SWAC has recently proved that &quot;2^89 + 1 = 3 *
   179 * 62020897 * 18584774046020617,&quot; a new valuable result.

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   In an earlier paper[<a href="#ref_11">11</a>] we have recorded the numbers of digits in <I>s</I>12,
   <I>s</I>13, and <I>s</I>14 to be, respectively, 1172, 2343, and 4686. 2^2309 and 2^2297
   in order possess 696 and 692 digits. Since <I>s</I>11 has only 586 digits it is
   clear that <I>s</I>12 would cover the present project for SWAC relative to
   2^<I>p</I> - 1, <I>p</I> prime. Extensions of these data and their implications may be
   derived from the following elaborations of the initial and final sequences
   of figures in <I>s</I>12. The first 134 figures read 2231 39958 67897 90076
   96037 96342 29578 85662 08710 40916 51298 31038 16096 83114 91946 22031
   98934 07703 85772 14379 57260 31497 87541 60034 50340 10407 89215 and the
   last 128 figures (ending at the unwritten decimal point) are 790 13713
   78462 70954 69233 91035 93130 68881 74580 89003 06832 76492 57250 08680
   49200 61619 79334 98686 55052 18272 48591 48886 69136 96655 34697 14434.
   The joy (?) of computing the 910 intermediate figures may be left to some
   electronic giant and its trainer.

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   My indebtedness to Professor Lehmer is appreciably enhanced and
   gratefully acknowledged because of the following additional information
   which he imparted to me in a letter dated June 16, 1952.

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   &quot;The reason why <I>p</I> has to be less than 2309 has to do with the fact that
   the SWAC has only 256 numbers of 36 binary digits each in its internal
   memory. One half of this capacity is used for instructions. The other
   half has to hold the 2<I>p</I> binary digits of <I>U</I>[<I>n</I>] and <I>U</I>[<I>n</I>+1] Hence 2<I>p</I> &lt;=
   128*36 so that <I>p</I> &lt;= 2304. Of course you could not have known about these
   details.&quot; Now the preceding paragraphs have come to a conclusion which
   befits a brief account of the magnificent recent progress in the Mersenne
   number field.

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   Paging Peter Barlow, Esq.! On August 21, 1952, the present author
   received from Professor D. H. Lehmer a note containing the following very
   exciting important facts: On June 25 the SWAC discovered that the
   Mersenne-like number 2^1279 - 1 is prime. &quot;We have tested this number
   quite a number of times since. At high speed it takes less than 13 1/2
   minutes. You may be interested in knowing that the 1277th term of the
   sequence 4, 14, ... is congruent to -2^640 mod (2^1279 - 1).&quot; The last
   item may be looked upon as an additional check but the minus sign alone
   is informative.

   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The writer immediately began to calculate on the base ten the exact
   values of <I>M</I>1279 and the fifteenth perfect number <I>v</I>15. The value of 2^1279
   was obtained by multiplying 2^1213 X 2^66 = 73786 97629 48382 06464. (vide
   supra). The same 386-digit number had been worked out earlier by Dr. John
   W. Wrench, Jr. Verbal comparison of the two independent results showed
   them to be identical.
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <I>M</I>1279 = 1 04079 32194 66439 90819 25240

   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The first calculation of <I>v</I>15 = (2^1278)(2^1279 - 1) = 2^2557 - 2^1278 --
   the result of which is given below -- obviously necessitated the
   evaluation of 2^2557. Since the latter datum, if published, was not
   available to me, I formed the 770-digit product of 2^2222 X 2^335 because
   these data were known to be absolutely correct. These powers of 2 possess
   669 and 101 digits, respectively. The new result is
   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   <I>v</I>15 = 54162 52628 43658 47412 65446 53743 91316 14085 64905 39031

   <br>
   <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
   The accuracy of this value of <I>v</I>15 deserves confidence because for every
   one of the 86 sums-of-products-of-nonads involved in 2^335 X 2^2222 the
   value was checked at once by an auxiliary modulus and later the definitive
   product 2^2557 was shown to agree congruently with the product of the
   separate factors on the basis of larger moduli. Incidentally the digits
   0, 1, 2 ... 7, 8, 9 occur respectively in <I>v</I>15 67, 74, 84, 73, 84, 80, 76,
   76, 69, 87 times.
