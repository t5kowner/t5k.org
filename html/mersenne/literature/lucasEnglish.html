          We have seen that the number of possibilities for the game of parquet with
          a board of 64 squares, is equal to 2<sup>64</sup>.

          Decreasing this number 2<sup>64</sup> by one, one gets the number of seeds which
          would cover the chessboard, assuming one seed on the first square, two on the
          next square, four on the next one, and so one, doubling until the sixty-fourth square.

          <a href="#BrisseNote1">
            The number 2<sup>64</sup>-1 is an example of a <I>Mersenne number</I></a>
          which we discussed in

          <a href="#BrisseNote2">
            note VI of Volume I</a>.

          In this respect Mr. <nobr>Le Lasseur</nobr> just found that the numbers
          <br><br>
          <center>
            2<sup>97</sup>-1,
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<sup>211</sup>-1,
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<sup>151</sup>-1,
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2<sup>223</sup>-1,
          </center>

          <br>
          are respectively divisible by

          <br>
          and verified that the other numbers 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>-1 for 24 values of prime n up to
          257, have no divisors less than <nobr>30&nbsp;000</nobr>.

          These new computations support
          our conjecture that Fermat and Mersenne knew a powerful method of factoring
          integers, unknown today, but that we believe to have largely rediscovered.

          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          On our trip to Rome, with the good will and generosity of his Excellency
          Prince B. Boncompagni, we consulted two precious volumes of manuscripts
          containing more than forty letters from Fermat to Mersenne.

          In a letter dated from Toulouse, April 7, 1643, one finds the following text:
          &laquo;You ask whether the number

          <br><br>
          <center>100
            &nbsp;&nbsp;895
            &nbsp;&nbsp;598
            &nbsp;&nbsp;169</center>

          <br>
          is prime or not, and for a method to discover, within one day,
          whether it is prime or composite. To this question, I answer that the
          number is composite and is the product of these two primes

          <br><br>
          <center><a href="#BrisseNote3">898 423</a>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;112 303,</center>

          <br>
          which are primes.

          I remain always, reverend Father, your very humble and very affectionate
          servant, Fermat.&raquo;

          To appreciate the efficacy of this method, one will observe that no extensive
          tables of prime numbers then existed and that the six digits numbers were not
          to be found in existing tables. Also there does not exist any known

          method to quickly decompose twelve digit numbers into primes.

          If we compare with more modern methods, we see Gauss, in the sixth section of
          <i>Disquitiones arithmeticae</i>, proposing several methods to
          distinguish prime numbers from composite ones, and to factor these into
          primes. It is, adds Gauss, one of the most important and useful problems of Arithmetic (no 329).

          He takes as an example the number

          <br><br>
          <center>314 159 265</center>

          <br>
          which, by dividing out the factors 3<sup>2</sup>, 5, 7, reduces to a six digit number
          in Burckhardt�s tables:

          <br><br>
          <center>997 331 = 127 &times; 7853.</center>

          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Gauss� methods would be unable to solve the problem posed by Mersenne to Fermat.

          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          If one is not able to factor Mersenne numbers by the use of the various methods
          known today, one can verify that those numbers are prime by applying the following
          analog of Wilson�s theorem.
          <i>For the number p=2<sup>4q+3</sup>-1 to be a prime,
            it is necessary and sufficient that the congruence

            <br><br>
            <center><img src="lucasImg/formule1.gif" width=174 height=36 border=0 alt="congruence"></center>

            i.e.

            <br>
            <center><img src="lucasImg/formule2.gif" width=288 height=46 border=0 alt="equation"></center>

            is satisfied after the successive removal of radicals.
          </i>

          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          In other words, one forms the sequence of numbers V<sub><i>n</i></sub>

          <br><br>
          <center>1, 3, 7, 47, 2207, ...</center>

          <br>
          such that, from the third one, any number is equal to the square of the previous one minus 2;
          one removes multiples of <i>p</i>, and if the number of rank 4<i>q</i>+2 is zero, <i>p</i> is prime.

          We indicated a way of computing using binary numbers which leads to the construction of a
          procedure appropriate to the verification of large primes.

          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          In this system, the multiplication consists only in the longitudinal displacement of the
          multiplicand; moreover, it is clear that the remainder of the division of
          2<sup><i>m</i></sup> by 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>-1 equals to 2<sup><i>r</i></sup>,
          <i>r</i> being the remainder of the

          will suffice to operate on numbers with at most 31 binary digits.

          on December 25 1640: &laquo;If I can determine the basic reason why

          <br><br>
          <center>3, 5, 7, 17, 257, 65 537, ...,</center>
          <br>
          are prime numbers, I feel that I would find very interesting results, for I
          have already found marvelous things [along these lines] which I will tell
          you about later.&raquo;.

          Euler was the first to prove that Fermat�s conjecture
          was false by showing that
          F<sub>5</sub> is divisible by 641.

          Through the use of a method indicated by Fermat himself, Euler proved:

          <i>The prime divisors of 2<sup>4<i>q</i></sup>+1 are of the linear form 8<i>hq</i>+1</i>.

          For example, it is sufficient to
          try to divide F<sub>5</sub> by the numbers

          <br><br>
          <center>193, 257, 449, 577, 641,</center>

          <br>
          to find with Euler

          <br><br>
          <center>F<sub>5</sub> = 641 &times; 6 700 417.</center>

          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          We have shown (<i>Acad&eacute;mie de Turin</i>, 27 January 1878), that the <i>prime
            divisors of 2<sup>4q</sup>+1 are of the form 16hq+1</i>.

          The use of that theorem
          decreases by more than half the labor of searching for divisors, and so for
          example, it is unnecessary (Euler and
          <a href="#LucasNote1">M. Tchebychef<sup>1</sup></a>),
          to try to divide by the four primes 193, 257, 449 and 577.

          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Similarly, the first possible divisor for F<sub>12</sub>
          is 7&middot;2<sup>14</sup>+1 or
          <nobr>114 689;</nobr>
          the trial succeeds and one concludes that
          F<sub>12</sub> is not a prime.

          Again, the first divisor to try for F<sub>23</sub> is
          5&middot;2<sup>25</sup>+1 or
          <nobr>167 772 161,</nobr>
          and M. Pervouchine, an orthodox priest in Perm, [Russia] verified that the
          number F<sub>23</sub>, which is composed of
          <nobr>2 525 223</nobr>
          digits is composite.

          All these results are readily verified by using congruances.

          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          To determine whether a number F<sub><i>n</i></sub>
          is prime or not, one forms the series

          <br><br>
          <center>6, 34, 1154,...,</center>

          <br>
          such that every one equals the square of the previous one minus two, discarding
          the multiples of F<sub><i>n</i></sub>; for F<sub><i>n</i></sub> to be prime, it is
          necessary that the residue of rank 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>-1 be zero.

          We did the computation for n=6, and
          found by that way that the twenty digit number
          2<sup>64</sup>+1 is composite; (<i>Sylvester's journal</i>, Vol. II, p. 238).

          Using that result

          and the simplification indicated above, to find divisors, Mr. Landry,
          at the age of 82 , after several months� work obtained the following result

          <br><br>
          <center>2<sup>64</sup>+1 = 274 177 &times; 67 280 421 310 721,</center>

          <br>
          as one can verify now in few minutes.


          Further, Messers. Landry and LeLasseur
          proved separately, that the second factor is prime.

          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
          Modifying Fermat�s conjecture, we hypothesize &laquo;All the primes and
          the only primes of the form 2<sup>n</sup> + 1 are found in the sequence

          <br>
          <center><img src="lucasImg/formule5.gif" width=276 height=39 border=0 alt="">&raquo;</center>

          <br>
          On the other hand, Eisenstein conjectured (perhaps he has a proof:)
          &laquo;<i>There are infinitely many prime numbers of the form
            2<sup>2<sup><i>n</i></sup></sup> + 1;</i>&raquo; There are no known
          proofs of these two propositions.
