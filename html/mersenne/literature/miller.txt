                             Large Primes

                          By J. C. P. MILLER

FOR seventy-five years, and in spite of many attempts to beat it,
the largest known prime has been p = 2^127 - 1, identified as such by
E. Lucas.  Recently D. J. Wheeler and I have succeeded in identifying
some larger ones, making use of Edsac.  We have used Fermat's theorem
to test numbers in the arithmetic progression N = kp + 1, p as above,
selecting values of k for which N has no factor less than 400.
  Fermat's theorem states that if N is prime and if a is prime to N,
then
                         a^(N-1) == 1 (mod N).
We chose a = 2, and found this to be true for k = 114, 124, 388, 408,
498, 696, 738, 774, 780, 934, 978. (Each machine test took three
minutes; there were also about ninety unsuccessful trial k's.) However,
the converse of Fermat's theorem is not true, as can be seen from the
special cases
    2^340 == 1 (mod 341); a^560 == 1 (mod 561), for a prime to 561.
Hence further work is needed to show that the values of k listed above
give primes--as, in fact, they do.
  To see that this is so, we argue as follows.  For a particular k
making 2 (mod N), suppose that e is the least exponent such that
                           2^e == 1 (mod N).
It is readily seen that e is a factor of N - 1, i.e. that
                        lambda*e = N - 1 = kp.
Hence either (i) e is a multiple of p,
          or (ii) k is a multiple of e, so that 2^k== 1 (mod N).
When k < 1024, it can be shown fairly easily that N is too big for
(ii) to be possible, hence (i) must hold.
  In case (i), suppose N = (q^alpha)(r^beta)(s^gamma) ... in prime
factors.  Now, there is a least exponent f such that 2^f == 1 (mod
q^alpha).  But, since q^alpha is a factor of N,
                  2^e == 1 (mod N) == 1 (mod ^alpha),
so that f is a factor of e.  The same is true for g, h, . corresponding
to r^beta, s^gamma, . . .  Hence e is a common multiple of g, h, . . .;
but if E is any common multiple of f, g, h, . . .,
                2^E == 1 (mod q^alpha), (mod r^beta), . . . ,
and hence       2^E == 1 (mod N);
it follows that e is the least common multiple of f, g, h, . . .  Hence,
as e contains a factor p, so must at least one of f, g, h, . . . , say
f: i.e. f = mu*p.
  By Fermat's theorem,
                         2^(q-1) == 1 (mod q),
and an extension can be proved showing that
                2^((q-1)q(alpha-1)) == 1 (mod q^alpha)
hence f = mu*p is a factor of (q - 1)q(alpha-1).  But clearly p =
(N -1)/k cannot divide q^(alpha-1), a factor of N; hence it divides
q - 1, and the prime q = nu*p + 1.
Hence N = kp + 1 == (nu*p + 1)(tau*p + s), say, whence s = 1 and, since
k << p, nu*tau*p^2 = 0; thus tau = 0 and nu = k (since nu =/ 0); and
N = kp^2 + 1 = nu*p + 1 is prime.
 The values of k listed above thus all give prime numbers and each was,
in succession, and for a few weeks, days, or hours, the largest known
prime.
  Wheeler then became more ambitious and tried the sequence N = kp^2 + 1,
first removing all k for which N has a factor less than 20,000.  By
precisely similar arguments it can be shown that if the Fermat test is
satisfied, N must have at least one prime factor nu*p + i. Then
                 N = kp^2 + 1 = (nu*p + 1) (tau*p + s).
As before s = 1.  Also (nu + tau)p must be a multiple of p^2; hence,
since both are positive, one must be of order p.  Thus nu*tau*p^2 is
zero, since it cannot be of order p^3; so tau = 0, nu = kp, and N ==
kp^2 + 1 = nu*p + 1 is prime.
  The test was satisfied (twenty-seven minutes on Edsac, after seven
similar abortive trials) for k = 180.  The resulting number, P, is the
largest known prime at present and has 79 decimal digits;
                      P = 180(2^127 - 1)^2 + 1 =
5210 64401 56792 28794 06069 43253 90955 85333 58984 83908 05645 83521
83851 01837 25557 35221.

ADDENDUM.--Since the above note was written, I have heard in a letter
from A. Ferrier (France) that he has identified as prime the number
(2^148 + 1)/17, by showing the Fermat test to be satisfied for a = 3,
and with the help of certain auxiliary calculations to supplement this
test.  This number, namely
         2098 89366 57440 58648 61512 64256 61022 25938 63921,
is thus the second largest prime known.
