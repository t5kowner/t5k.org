   1. <b>Mersenne numbers.</b> The Mersenne numbers are of the form
   2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1. As a result of the computation described below, it can now be
   stated that the first seventeen primes of this form correspond to the
   following values of <I>n</I>:

   <p>
      <center>
         2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61, 89, 107, 127, 521, 607, 1279, 2203, 2281.
      </center>

   <p>
      The first seventeen even perfect numbers are therefore obtained by
      substituting these values of <I>n</I> in the expression 2<sup><I>n</I>-1</sup>(2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1).
      The first twelve of the Mersenne primes have been known since 1914; the
      twelfth, 2<FONT SIZE="-1"><sup>127</sup></FONT>-1, was indeed found by Lucas as early as 1876, and for
      the next seventy-five years was the largest known prime. More details
      on the history of the Mersenne numbers may be found in Archibald
      [<B><a href="#ref_01">1</a></B>]; see also Kraitchik [<B><a href="#ref_04">4</a></B>]. The next five Mersenne
      primes were
      found in 1952; they are at present the five largest known primes of
      any form. They were announced in Lehmer [<B><a href="#ref_07">7</a></B>] and discussed by
      Uhler [<B><a href="#ref_13">13</a></B>].

      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      It is clear that 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1 can be factored algebraically if <I>n</I> is composite;
      hence 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1 cannot be prime unless <I>n</I> is prime. Fermat's theorem
      yields a factor of 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1 only when <I>n</I>+1 is prime, and hence does not
      determine any additional cases in which 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1 is known to be composite.
      On the other hand, it follows from Euler's criterion that if
      <I>n</I> == 0, 3 (mod 4) and 2<I>n</I>+1 is prime, then 2<I>n</I>+1 is a factor of 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1.
      Thus, in addition to cases in which <I>n</I> is composite, we see that 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1
      is composite when 2<I>n</I>+1 is prime as well as <I>n</I>, provided that <I>n</I>
      == 3 (mod 4) and <I>n</I> &gt; 3. Aside from this, factors of 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1 are known
      only in individual cases. If no factor is known, the best way to find
      out whether 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1 is prime is to apply a test due essentially to Lucas,
      but stated in a simplified form by Lehmer [<B><a href="#ref_06">6</a></B>, Theorem 5.4].

   <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;
      T<font size="-1">HEOREM</font>.
      <I>Let S</I><SUB>1</SUB> = 4, <I>S</I><SUB><I>k</I>+1</SUB> = <I>S</I><SUB><I>k</I></SUB><sup>2</sup>-2. <I>Then,
         for n</I> &gt; 2, <I>the number</I>
      2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1 <I>is prime if and only if S</I><SUB><I>n</I>-1</SUB> == 0 (mod 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1).

   <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      Alternatively, we may start with <I>S</I><SUB>1</SUB> = 10; or, if <I>n</I> == 3 (mod 4), we
      may also use <I>S</I><SUB>1</SUB> = 3. Such a test was first applied by Lucas in 1876 to
      show that 2<FONT SIZE="-1"><sup>127</sup></FONT>-1 is prime. By 1947, all of the numbers 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1
      with
      <I>n</I> &lt;= 257 had been tested; if there had been no errors in the
      computations, this would have completed the proof or disproof of the various
      cases of Mersenne's conjecture of 1644. In 1951, the first application
      of an electronic computer to testing Mersenne numbers for primeness
      was made by A. M. Turing at the University of Manchester; however,
      no new primes were found, and no remainders were saved for
      purposes of comparison.

      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      In 1952, a program for testing Mersenne numbers for primeness
      on the SWAC (the National Bureau of Standards' Western Automatic
      Computer, at the Institute for Numerical Analysis in Los
      Angeles), planned and coded by the author, using Lucas's test, was
      carried out, with the cooperation of D. H. Lehmer and the staff of
      the I. N. A. My thanks are due especially to Emma Lehmer, who did
      various auxiliary computations, including checking some of the results
      obtained against earlier results. The program was first tried
      on the SWAC on January 30, and two new primes were found that
      day; three other primes were found on June 25, October 7, and
      October 9.

      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      At that time, the total memory of the SWAC consisted of 256
      words of 36 binary digits each, exclusive of the sign. For the Mersenne
      test, half of this memory was reserved for commands. Since successive
      squarings of numbers less than the modulus 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1 are required, this
      modulus was restricted to 64 words, so that the condition <I>n</I> &lt; 64 * 36
      = 2304 was imposed. The estimated running time for the program
      was 0.25<I>n</I><sup>3</sup>+125<I>n</I><sup>2</sup> microseconds, and the actual time was in fair
      agreement with this. Thus, roughly speaking, the testing time was a
      minute for the first and an hour for the last of the five new primes.
      Each minute of machine time is equivalent to more than a year's
      work for a person using a desk calculator.

      <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
      The output of the SWAC for each <I>n</I> was the least non-negative
      residue of <I>S</I><SUB><I>n</I>-1</SUB> (mod 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1), written to the base 16. This was a long
      string of zeros if 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1 was prime, and otherwise was an apparently
      random sequence of digits. Every value of <I>n</I>
      < 2304, for which no factor of 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1 was known, was run twice on the SWAC; in case of
         disagreement, a third run was made. No remainder was accepted as
         correct until it had been obtained twice, and indeed on different days.
         (Although the bulk of this work was done in 1952, the checking was
         not complete in all respects until late in 1953. The submission of this
         report was delayed for this reason.) It is of course out of the question
         to print the hundreds of remainders obtained, but they will remain
         on file at the Institute for Numerical Analysis. [<I>Added in proof</I>. On
         July 1, 1954, the I.N.A. became a part of the University of California
         at Los Angeles; it is now known as Numerical Analysis Research.]

         <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
         We shall confine ourselves here to mentioning various results of
         earlier computations which have been verified or contradicted. (In a
         few cases, earlier computers had used the test with <I>S</I><SUB>1</SUB> = 3; in these
         cases, the same computation was also made on the SWAC.) The six
         results of Uhler [<B><a href="#ref_12">12</a></B>], for <I>n</I>=157, 167, 193, 199, 227, 229, were all
         checked by him by converting the corresponding SWAC remainders
         to decimal form, and found to be correct. The rest of the checking
         was done by Emma Lehmer. The three results of D. H. Lehmer
         [<B><a href="#ref_05">5</a></B>],
         for <I>n</I> = 139, 149, 257, were all verified. (Although Lehmer's remainder
         for <I>n</I> = 139 had not been published, it was available for checking.) The
         result of Powers [<B><a href="#ref_10">10</a></B>] for <I>n</I>=241 was found to be correct; the remainders
         from his earlier computations, for <I>n</I> = 103, 109, had not
         been published, and were not available for checking. On the other
         hand, the four remainders of Fauquembergue [<B><a href="#ref_03">3</a></B>], for <I>n</I>=101, 103,
         109, 137 were all found to be incorrect, as was the remainder of
         Barker [<B><a href="#ref_02">2</a></B>] for <I>n</I> = 167.

         <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
         If 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1 is prime, so that <I>S</I><SUB><I>n</I>-1</SUB> == 0 (mod 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1),
         then <I>S</I><SUB><I>n</I>-2</SUB> is a
         solution of the congruence <I>x</I>
         <FONT SIZE="-1"><sup>2</sup></FONT> == 2 (mod 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1). Thus <I>S</I><SUB><I>n</I>-2</SUB> == +-
         2<sup>(<I>n</I>+1)/2</sup>
         (mod 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1). The calculation of the next to the last remainder <I>S</I><SUB><I>n</I>-2</SUB>
         was undertaken for the various known Mersenne primes, both with
         <I>S</I><SUB>1</SUB> = 4 and with <I>S</I><SUB>1</SUB> = 10, with the following results for the sign in the
         above congruence:

         <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            We have carried the program of testing Mersenne numbers for
            primeness about as far as is practicable using present day computers.
            The smallest untested Mersenne number is 2<FONT SIZE="-1"><sup>2309</sup></FONT>-1, which does not
            appear to be a case of exceptional interest. A more interesting case
            is 2<FONT SIZE="-1"><sup>8191</sup></FONT>-1, which should be prime according to a conjecture that
            2<sup><I>n</I></sup>-1 is always prime when <I>n</I> is a Mersenne prime. This conjecture
            is true for the first four cases, corresponding to the exponents
         <p>
            <center>
               3 = 2<FONT SIZE="-1"><sup>2</sup></FONT>-1, 7 = 2<FONT SIZE="-1"><sup>3</sup></FONT>-1, 31 = 2<FONT
                  SIZE="-1"><sup>5</sup></FONT>-1, and 127 = 2<FONT SIZE="-1"><sup>7</sup></FONT>-1.
            </center>
         <p>
            The fifth case corresponds to <I>n</I> = 8191 = 2<FONT SIZE="-1"><sup>13</sup></FONT>-1. The corresponding
            Mersenne number was actually tested in 1953 by D.J. Wheeler on
            the Illiac, at the University of Illinois, one hundred hours of machine
            time being required. The remainder obtained was not zero, indicating
            that the number is composite, and the conjecture therefore false.
            According to Dr. Wheeler, considerable confidence may be placed in
            this result, since the computation was carefully checked.

         <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            2. <b>Fermat numbers.</b> The Fermat numbers are of the form 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>+1.
            The only new result obtained here was that 2<FONT SIZE="-1"><sup>1024</sup></FONT>+1 is composite,
            and hence that a regular polygon with this number of sides cannot be
            constructed with ruler and compass.

            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The number 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>+1 can be factored algebraically unless <I>n</I> is a power
            of 2. Factors are known in a few other cases. If no factor is known,
            the following test may be used.

         <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            T<font size="-1">HEOREM</font>.
            <I>If n</I> &gt; 1, <I>then</I> 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>+1 <I>is prime if and only if</I> 3<sup>
               <FONT SIZE="-1">2<sup><I>n</I>-1</sup></FONT>
            </sup>
            == -1 (mod 2<sup><I>n</I></sup>+1).

         <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The program set up for testing Mersenne numbers on the SWAC
            was modified to apply to Fermat numbers. The range for the exponent
            <I>n</I> was the same, but with <I>n</I> = 2<sup><I>m</I></sup>, this yields <I>m</I> &lt;= 11. Now
            2<FONT SIZE="-1"><sup>2<sup><I>m</I></sup></sup></FONT>+1 is prime for <I>m</I> = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and factors
            were known for
            <I>m</I> = 5, 6, 9, 11. The Fermat numbers corresponding to <I>m</I> = 7, 8 had
            been proved composite by Morehead and Western
            [<B><a href="#ref_08">8</a></B>;<B><a href="#ref_09">9</a></B>], and the
            remainders which they gave were found to be correct. (The necessary
            conversion of the SWAC result to decimal form was done by Emma
            Lehmer.) In the one new case, <I>m</I> = 10, the least positive residue of
            3<FONT SIZE="-1"><sup>2<sup>
                     <FONT SIZE="-2">1023</FONT>
                  </sup></sup></FONT> (mod 2<FONT SIZE="-1"><sup>1024</sup></FONT>+1) was found to be
            <font size="-1">

            to the base 16, using 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,u,v,w,x,y,z as digits.
            Thus 2 +1 is composite. This result was first obtained in February
            1952. As an extra check in this case, the test was recoded by Emma
            Lehmer; the modified test was run in January 1953, and the above
            remainder was verified.

            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            Later in 1953, Selfridge [<B><a href="#ref_11">11</a></B>] showed that this Fermat number has
            the factor 11131*2<FONT SIZE="-1"><sup>12</sup></FONT>+1, which confirms the above result, but in a
            sense renders it obsolete even before it is submitted for publication.
            Selfridge also found a factor of 2<FONT SIZE="-1"><sup>2<sup>16</sup></sup></FONT>+1. Previously known
            factors of
            Fermat numbers may be found in Kraitchik [<B><a href="#ref_04">4</a></B>]. Factors of 2<FONT SIZE="-1">
               <sup>2<sup><I>m</I></sup></sup>
            </FONT>+1
            are now known for <I>m</I> = 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 18, 23, 36, 38, 73.

            <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
            The first Fermat number of unknown character is 2<FONT SIZE="-1"><sup>8192</sup></FONT>+1, corresponding
            to <I>m</I>=13. The difficulty of testing this number is about
            the same as for the Mersenne number 2<FONT SIZE="-1"><sup>8191</sup></FONT>-1. It would probably
            be considerably easier to find some additional factors of Fermat
            numbers by trial.
