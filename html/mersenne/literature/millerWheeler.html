          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For about seventy-five years the largest known
          prime number has been <I>P</I> = 2<sup>
            <FONT SIZE="-2">127</FONT>
          </sup> - 1,
          identified as
          such by Edouard Lucas. It has remained the largest
          known in spite of many attempts to identify larger
          ones, although there have been conjectures and claims
          insufficiently substantiated or entirely unproved.

          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently we have prepared a routine for testing
          on the Edsac the primality of numbers of the form
          <I>kP</I> + 1, with <I>P</I> as defined above, and have found
          ten values of <I>k</I> that give prime numbers. The largest
          of these gives the present (June 7) largest known
          prime, namely,

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Note added in proof (October 8)</I>. Further work on
          the Edsac by Wheeler and myself has demonstrated the primality of

          and culminated in early July in the identification of
          the present largest known prime,

            </sup> + 1.
          </center>

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, in early July, A. Ferrier, of France, using a
          desk machine, demonstrated the primality of
          <center>
            (2<sup>
              <FONT SIZE="-2">148</FONT>
            </sup> + 1)/17,
          </center>
          which is the second largest known prime.
