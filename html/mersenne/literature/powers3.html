		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have recently determined by the computation of Lucas'
		series 4, 14, 194,
		...<a href="#foot_1">[1]</a> that the number <I>N</I> = 2^241 - 1 is composite,
		since the 240th term of the series is congruent to
	<p>
		<TT> - 98 6778335538 8807227981 3604528486 9326522489 7467133466 0099172867 1619979800 (mod <I>N</I>).</TT>
	</p>
	This term would be zero if <I>N</I> were prime.
	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The square of each term was obtained by means of a
	computing machine, D. N. Lehmer's
	<I>cross-multiplication</I><a href="#foot_2">[2]</a> being
	used; and these squares, diminished by 2, were divided by <I>N</I>
	by hand, with the aid of a table of the 1000 multiples of <I>N</I>:
	<I>N</I>, 2<I>N</I>, 3<I>N</I>, ..., 1000<I>N</I>, the quotients being thus obtained
	three or more digits at a time, and the computation was checked
	throughout by the four moduli 9, 10^3+1, 10^4+1, and 10^7+1.
