<dt><a name=code></a>Proof-Codes</dt>
  <dd><p>Proof-codes are used by the system as a short way to give credit for each
submitted prime.&nbsp;  These are short strings (never more than four letters &
digits) which are linked to the list of the persons, programs and projects which
worked together to prove that number prime.&nbsp;�An individual may join different
project at different times, or may switch software...&nbsp; So each human prover has
one prover-account, but may own many proof-codes (BOINC users typically have just
one).&nbsp; Similarly each program/project has one prover-account, but may belong to
many proof-codes.&nbsp; These codes make prime submission easier and also serve as a
short way of giving credit on the text versions of the prime list.</p></dd>

<dt><a name=wild></a>Wild Codes</dt>
  <dd><p>Wild codes are generalized regular expressions used when a program is a member
of many proof-codes.&nbsp; For example, Proth.exe has the wild code '^GF\d+' to show
that every proof-code which starts with a lower case 'g' followed by one or more
digits is a code that uses Proth.exe during the primality proof.&nbsp; Since there are
several hundred of these, we do not want to list them all on the Proth.exe
prover-account page.</p>

<dt><a name=email></a>E-mail address</dt>
  <dd><p>The Prime Pages editors respect the privacy of all of its submitters.&nbsp; To
submit primes, they must provide an e-mail address so we can ask questions or verify
submitted data.&nbsp; We will not share this information with third parties and will
not post this e-mail address <b>unless</b> they request it using the 'edit biography'
page.&nbsp; If you allow the system to print your address, we suggest you have it
munged (an option when you edit your account) otherwise you are very likely to get
spammed.&nbsp; See our <a href=https://t5k.org/notes/privacy.html>privacy
statement</a>.</p></dd>

<dt><a name=name></a>Name</dt>
  <dd><p>The full name of the human prover or a short descriptive name of the program or
project.&nbsp; We prefer that the names are listed personal name first then the
family name: "John W. Smith". Please do not use all capitals.  Save your creativity
for the username.&nbsp; Finding a record prime is a good reason to use
your real name.</p></dd>

<dt><a name=sort></a>Last name</dt>
  <dd><p>The last name is used for sorting and to indicate an individual person, program
or project on thde prime list.&nbsp; It must be short, contain no white spaces, and
unique.&nbsp; It is used in many lists to identify the prover and is used to sort
the prover index.<.p>
  <p>Though it is sometimes possible to link to these pages using the
last name, you should not--use the prover's id instead.&nbsp; The id will not change,
but the username might.&nbsp;� (Editors may change them to improve readability, to
take them out of all upper-case form, to shorten them...)</p></dd>

<dt><a name=id></a>Prover id</dt>
  <dd><p>A unique positive integer specifying the prover-account.&nbsp;� Use this as the
primary means to link to a biography page (e.g.
<code>https://t5k.org/bios/page.php?id=9</code>).&nbsp;  Prover id's should
never change.</p></dd>

<dt><a name=total></a>Number of Primes</dt>
  <dd><p>The 'current list' contains the list of the 5,000 largest proven primes plus
select smaller primes.&nbsp;� However, the database stores the list of all of the
primes that have every made this list.&nbsp;� So there are two numbers indicated here:
the number of primes on the current list (which may change hourly) and the total
number that ever made any of the lists.&nbsp;� These numbers do not include primes
awaiting verification.&nbsp; <span class="warning">(Note that at first the database does
contain some primes that never made any list--these will be purged when I get a
chance, so this total number may drop once for some folks.)</span></p>
  <p><a name=adjusted></a>The total shown for persons or projects (not programs) is
adjusted by dividing by the number of other humans (or projects) in each relevant
code.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>For example, suppose the persons '<a
href=/bios/page.php?id=239>Carmody</a>' and '<a
href="/bios/page.php?id=9">Caldwell</a>' worked together and used the program '<a
href="/bios/page.php?id=411">PRP</a>' to test candidates selected by the '<a
href="/bios/page.php?id=441">GFN 2^13 Sieving project</a>', then completed their
proofs using '<a href="/bios/page.php?id=432">Proth.exe</a>'.&nbsp;� Then the persons
'Carmody' and 'Caldwell' would get 1/2 credit for each prime found; but the project
'GFN 2^13 Sieving project' and the programs 'PRP' and 'Proth.exe' would each get full
credit.</p>

<dt><a name=score></a>Production Score</dt>
  <dd><p>The production score is an attempt to rate the amount of effort used to find
primes.&nbsp;� See the bottom of the <a
href="https://t5k.org/bios/top20.php?type=person&by=ScoreRank">Top Twenty
Prover</a> pages for an explanation.</p></dd>

<dt><a name=bio></a>Autobiographical data</dt>
  <dd><p>The autobiographical data is information provided by the person, programmer or
project coordinator.&nbsp; It may be edited if necessary to remove any inappropriate
text or code.&nbsp; The Prime Pages are not responsible for what individual write
themselves.&nbsp;</p>
   <p>Young provers should always leave this section blank or make <b>very</b> sure that the
do not include any identifying information.</p></dd>
