Finding very large primes is inherently difficult.&nbsp;  Some of the
algorithms for special forms can be easy to understand, but programming them
requires fast multiplication of very large numbers.&nbsp;  Choosing which
number to test can also require thought.&nbsp;  Before using the main
primality tests we also should strongly consider presieving with some
type of trial division program.

<P>A variety of programmers have done their best to make this easier for
you.&nbsp; For example, on the top twenty list you can see those programs that
have used while finding the most primes.&nbsp;  But if you look at this list
closely you will see we are comparing apples and oranges--the programs in the list
often do very different things.&nbsp;  Below I will explain the very rough
categories we have divided these programs into.

<blockquote>
<dl>

<dt>sieve
  <dd>A sieve quickly removes the numbers that have small composite 
divisors from large set of potentially prime numbers.&nbsp;  Folks that find the
record twins, for example, sieve very heavily before they use more
definitive (and time consuming) primality tests. 

<dt>minus
  <dd>We can prove a number <i>N</i> is prime if we have enough factors of
<i>N</i>-1.&nbsp; Programs that implement this type of test for a reasonably broad
class of numbers are indicated with 'minus' in the database.

<dt>plus
  <dd>We can also prove a number <i>N</i> is prime if we have enough factors of
<i>N</i>+1.&nbsp; Programs that implement this type of test for a reasonably broad
class of numbers are indicated with 'plus' in the database.

<dt>classical
  <dd>There are ways of combining factors of <i>N</i>-1 and <i>N</i>+1, as well as
factors of <i>N</i><sup><i>k</i></sup>-1 for small integers <i>k</i>.&nbsp;
Programs that implement some relatively large part of these combined tests are
marked with 'classical' in the database.

<dt>special
  <dd>'special' is just that, the program implements some test that works
only for a very special form of prime (e.g., Prime95 implements just the
Lucas-Lehmer test for Mersennes, but does it exceptionally well!)

<dt>general
  <dd>The hardest type of program to write is perhaps one that will
quickly show a large number prime without using the classical tests
above.&nbsp;  Those few that do are marked 'general'.

<dt>other
  <dd>I am not sure what this means yet.&nbsp; Certainly something other 
than the above...

Notes:

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The above categories are very broad and roughly applied.&nbsp; To see
what a program really does, go to its web site.

<li>I only list programs used to find several primes on the list of the
largest known primes.&nbsp; Look elsewhere for programs that work for small
numbers (say less than 5,000 digits).
