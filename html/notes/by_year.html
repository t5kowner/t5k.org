      <p class="note">For information on the French Monk Marin Mersenne's prime
        conjecture and its errors, <a href="/mersenne/index.html#monk">see this link</a></p>
      <p>Many early writers felt (incorrectly) that if <i>p</i> was prime, then so
        was M<sub><i>p</i></sub> = 2<sup><i>p</i></sup>-1.&nbsp; These numbers, now
        called the <a href="/mersenne/index.html">Mersenne Numbers</a>, were the
        focus of most of the early searches for large primes.&nbsp; The early history
        of these numbers is strewn with many false claims of primality, even by such
        notables as Mersenne, Leibniz, and Euler.&nbsp; So we give credit to our first
        record holder with some doubt:</p>
      <blockquote class="record"> by 1588 Pietro Cataldi had correctly verified that
        2<sup>17</sup>-1 = 131071 and 2<sup>19</sup>-1 = 524287 are both prime [<a
          href="/references/refs.cgi/Cataldi1603">Cataldi1603</a>]. </blockquote>
      <p>But Cataldi also had incorrectly stated 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>-1 was also prime
        for each of 23, 29, 31 and 37.&nbsp; This is interesting because Cataldi made
        his discoveries by constructing what Shanks calls &quot;the first extensive table
        of primes--up to 750&quot; [<a href="/references/refs.cgi/Shanks78">Shanks78</a>, p14].&nbsp; These
        tables are big enough to show 2<sup>19</sup>-1 is prime (its square root is
        approximately 724) but <i>not</i> large enough to handle these four larger
        numbers!</p>
      <p class="note">Note: Some writers (e.g., [<a href="/references/refs.cgi/Picutti1989">Picutti1989</a>]
        and [<a href="/references/refs.cgi/BS96">BS96</a>, p309]) include
        the primes 8191=2<sup>13</sup>-1 (before 1458, Codice Palatino 573) and 131071=2<sup>17</sup>-1
        (1460, Codex Ottb. Lat 3307) in their list of records.&nbsp; But we omit them
        for lack of evidence that they were proven primes at that time, rather than
        just lucky guesses.</p>
      <p>In 1640 Fermat showed that if <i>p</i> is an odd prime, then all prime divisors
        of 2<sup><i>p</i></sup>-1 have the form 2<i>kp</i>+1.&nbsp; He then quickly
        showed Cataldi was wrong about 23 (which has the factor 47 with <i>k</i>=1)
        and 37 (factor 223 at <i>k</i>=3).&nbsp; Finally, in 1738, Euler showed Cataldi
        was also wrong about 29 by finding the divisor 233.&nbsp; Here, using Fermat's
        result, <i>k</i>=4.&nbsp; This is just the second number to try using Fermat's
        result as <i>k</i>=2 and <i>k</i>=3 yield composites (so I would guess Fermat
        also knew of this factor).&nbsp; Note that Cataldi's errors were shown with
        small factors found in Cataldi's own table of primes, and none took more than
        two trial divisions! <a id="31"></a></p>
      <p>Euler gives us the first clear record (except perhaps for the date) by proving
        Cataldi was correct about 31:</p>
      <blockquote class="record"> by 1772 Euler had used clever reasoning and trial division
        to show 2<sup>31</sup>-1 = 2147483647 is prime. </blockquote>
      <p>The actual date must be between 28 October 1752 when Euler sent a letter
        to Goldbach [<a href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/~euler/correspondence/letters/OO0877.pdf">text</a> from <a
          href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/%7Eeuler/">Euler
          Archive</a>] stating that he was uncertain about this number (even though he
        had earlier listed it as prime) and 1772 when a letter [<a
          href="http://www.math.dartmouth.edu/%7Eeuler/docs/originals/E461.pdf">text</a>] was published
        from Euler to Bernoulli stating he proved 2<sup>31</sup>-1 prime by showing
        all prime divisors of 2<sup>31</sup>-1
        must have one of the two forms 248<i>n</i>+1 and 248<i>n</i>+63, and then dividing
        by all such primes less than 46339 [<a href="/references/refs.cgi/Dickson19">Dickson19</a>, pp18-19].&nbsp; This
        requires <a href="proofs/MerDiv.html">a simple theorem</a> which is stronger
        than Fermat's result above.&nbsp; (Euler had listed 2<sup>31</sup>-1 a prime
        as early as 1732,
        but he did so along with 2<sup>41</sup>-1 and 2<sup>47</sup>-1
        both of which were composite [<span title="dead link (do you know the correct one?)
http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/math/pdf/0501/0501118.pdf">translation</span>].)</p>
      <p class="note">Note: Some writers (e.g., [<a href="/references/refs.cgi/BS96">BS96</a>, p309]) include
        the primes 999999000001 (1851, &quot;found&quot; by Looff) and 67280421310721
        (1 Jan. 1855, Clausen) in their tables.&nbsp; The first appeared in a table
        of Looff with a question mark, but Reuschle [<a href="/references/refs.cgi/Reuschle1856">Reuschle1856</a>,
        pp.3,18] claims Looff had proved it prime.&nbsp; Thomas Clausen provided the
        factorization 274177 &middot; 67280421310721 of 2<sup>64</sup>+1 in a letter to Gauss
        dated 1 Jan 1855 stating both factors were prime [<a
          href="/references/refs.cgi/Biermann1964">Biermann1964</a>].&nbsp; But
        it remains a claim without a method.</p>
      <p>By 1867 Landry had found a larger prime, still by trial division, as a factor
        of 2<sup>59</sup>-1 (namely (2<sup>59</sup>-1)/179951 = 3203431780337), this
        prime held the record longer than any other <b>non</b>-Mersenne would (before
        or after his discovery).&nbsp; However all such efforts were to be eclipsed
        by a new mathematical discovery, so we pause for a moment to summarize all
        record primes (that I know about) before modern computers.&nbsp; (In the long
        run, it is always the mathematics that decide how large of prime we can find.)</p>

      <p> By 1876 Lucas had developed a clever test to determine if Mersenne numbers
        were prime.&nbsp; His method was later <a href="/mersenne/index.html#test">made
          even simpler by Lehmer</a> in the 1930's, and is still used to discover the
        record primes!</p>
      <blockquote class="record"> In 1876 Lucas proved that 2<sup>127</sup>-1 = 170141183460469231731687303715884105727
        was prime. </blockquote>
      <p>&quot;This remained the largest known prime until 1951&quot; [<a href="/references/refs.cgi/HW79">HW79</a>,
        p16] And this
        record, which stood for 75 years, may stand forever as the largest prime found <i>by
          hand calculations</i>.</p>
      <p>In 1951 Ferrier used a mechanical desk calculator and techniques based on
        partial inverses of Fermat's little theorem (see the pages on <a href="/prove/">finding and proving primes</a>)
        to slightly
        better this record by finding a 44 digit prime:</p>
      <blockquote class="record"> In 1951 Ferrier found the prime (2<sup>148</sup>+1)/17
        = 20988936657440586486151264256610222593863921. </blockquote>
      <p>With this record we end the period before electronic computers, for in this same
        year a new record of 79 digits was to be set by computer.</p>
      <p class="note">Note: It is quite difficult to place Ferrier's discovery among
        Miller &amp; Wheeler's

      <p>This record was soon eclipsed by Raphael Robinson's discoveries of five new

        time he tried it! Not only that, but his program found two new record primes
        that very day!&nbsp; He writes [<a href="/references/refs.cgi/Robinson54">Robinson54</a>]:</p>
      <blockquote class="record"> The program was first tried on the SWAC on January
        30, and two new primes were found that day [M<sub>521</sub>, M<sub>607</sub>],

        by Newman, this first attempt at finding primes by (electronic) computers
        is sometimes attributed to him (e.g., [<a href="/references/refs.cgi/Robinson54">Robinson54</a>] and
        [<a href="/references/refs.cgi/Ribenboim95">Ribenboim95</a>,
        p93]).&nbsp; The excellent <a href="http://www.turing.org.uk/turing/scrapbook/manmach.html">Alan
          Turing Internet Scrapbook</a> has a picture of this machine.</p>
      <p>We see the records of Miller, Wheeler, and Robinson as the first points on
        the following graph--note the vertical scale!</p>
      <p>Progress over the next few years was as steady as the increase in speed of
        computers.&nbsp; Riesel found M<sub>3217</sub> using the Swedish machine BESK;
        Hurwitz found M<sub>4253</sub> and M<sub>4423</sub> using an IBM 7090 (see
        next paragraph); Gillies used the ILLIAC-2 to find M<sub>9689</sub>, M<sub>9941</sub> and
        M<sub>11213</sub>. Tuckerman found M<sub>19937</sub> using an IBM360.</p>
      <p>Surprisingly Hurwitz knew about M<sub>4423</sub> seconds before M<sub>4253</sub> (because
        of the way the output was stacked).&nbsp; John Selfridge asked &quot;Does a machine
        result need to be observed by a human before it can be said to be 'discovered'?&quot;&nbsp; To
        which Hurwitz replied, &quot;forgetting about whether the computer knew, what if
        the computer operator who piled up the output looked?&quot;&nbsp; In the table below
        I decided that Hurwitz discovered the prime when he read the output, so M<sub>4253</sub> was
        never the largest known prime.</p>

      <a id="bevaprime"></a>
      <p><b>When will we have a one billion digit prime?</b> Good question! In the early days of the GIMPS search, my
        predictions were reasonable, but recently things have taken a turn (see the graph) that defies prediction using
        simple regressions and past history. My last prediction was way off!</p>
      <p>I am getting out of the time prediction business. So we will end with a linear graph and a gratuitous cubic
        below. Useful future predictions should be based not only on heuristics such as found on the page <a
          href="/notes/faq/NextMersenne.html">Where is the Next Mersenne?</a>, but should also track the usage data for
