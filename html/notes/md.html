    <p>[See the later note of <a href="md6-96.html">19 Jun 1996</a>]

    <p>I am pleased to send you some new values of pi(x):
        ( 2e18 means 2.10^(18) and so on...)

    <blockquote class="blockquote">
        <pre>
pi(2e18) 		=  48 645 161 281 738 535
pi(3e18) 		=  72 254 704 797 687 083
pi(4e18) 		=  95 676 260 903 887 607
pi(4185296581467695669) = 100 000 000 000 000 000 
pi(5e18) 		= 118 959 989 688 273 472
pi(6e18) 		= 142 135 049 412 622 144
pi(7e18) 		= 165 220 513 980 969 424
pi(8e18) 		= 188 229 829 247 429 504
pi(9e18) 		= 211 172 979 243 258 278
pi(1e19) 		= 234 057 667 276 344 607

    These values have been checked
    <ol>
        <li>by computing pi(x) and pi(x + 1e7) and checking that the number of primes in
            the short interval agrees with the two values of pi.
        <li>or
            by computing them two times with different values of 2 parameters
            y and z used during the computation.
    </ol>

    (Thanks to Paul Zimmermann from INRIA Nancy who lend me some hours of
    computation on his Silicon Graphics and between other values got
    the pi(418....) = 10^17).

    <p>The method is presented in Math of Comp 1996 by
        Deleglise & Rivat: Computing Pi(x), the Meissel, Lehmer, Lagarias,
        Miller, Odlyzko method [<a href="/references/refs.cgi/DR96">DR96</a>].
        The program is an improved implementation of the precedent version.
        The asymptotic time and space complexity are unchanged (O(x^(2/3)/logx^2)
        for time and O(x^(1/3)logx^3) for space);

    <p>It is running about 2 times faster and needs less memory.
        The last value took 40 hours of computation on a DEC-Alpha 5/250
        and needed about 80Mo memory.
        I got some other intermediate values that are waiting to be checked.
        I hope to send you some new bigger values after a while.

    <p>Marc Deleglise.
