			<u>New Mersenne Prime! 2^1398269-1 is prime!</u>
		<p>

			Thanks to everyone's hard work, GIMPS (Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search)
			has discovered the 35th known Mersenne Prime! Joel Armengaud made the
			discovery on November 13. Amazingly, he kept this secret while he
			double-checked the find on two other computers. On the 18th, he notified
			Richard Crandall, Chris Caldwell, and myself. I verified it on my machine
			on the 20th. Slowinski, who was out of town at the time, provided the
			independent verification on the 22nd.

			<li><a href="/notes/1398269/">https://t5k.org/notes/1398269</a>
		</ul>

		As had been agreed upon before hand, credit for this new prime will go
		to Armengaud, Woltman, et al.<p>

			We were incredibly lucky to find this prime. In percentage terms, this
			is the 6th smallest gap between Mersenne exponents. The range from
			1,000,000 to 2,000,000 was expected to contain 1.78 Mersenne primes.
			There are already 2 known and probablities suggest there will be one more.
			Let's go find that one too!

			Congratulations to all,<br>
			George Woltman<br>
