			Hello Mersenne Searchers,
		<p>

			I am very happy to announce that we have found a new Mersenne Prime!!!
			This is the 35th known Mersenne number, and the biggest so far:

			Many thanks to all of you, to you George, who made the fastest program I
			have ever seen on a Pentium, and to all the Apsylog Development Team
			fellows, who let me run Prime95.exe on 18 Pentiums and P-PROs.
		<p>
