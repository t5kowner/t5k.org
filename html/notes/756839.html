      <h2>Adrian Powell recalls the discovery of the 32<i>nd</i> Mersenne</h2>
      <p>It was roughly 7 pm on Wednesday 19th
        February 1992, when a Cray Research Analyst at Harwell Lab in Didcot,
        Oxfordshire, UK was just about to start a regular software maintenance
        slot on the research Labs Cray-2 supercomputer.</p>
      <p>It had been a busy
        few days with one thing and another in preparation to test the very
        latest and greatest Unicos operating system, which was released to the
        field on a regular basis.&nbsp; Over the last couple of days the analyst had
        been busy building and configuring this latest software release, leaving
        little time for the kind of system checks that need to be carried
        out on a weekly basis. </p>
      <p>On the Monday of that week though, he had briefly
        displayed a logfile which was being produced by a special program called
        <code>mprime</code>.&nbsp; <code>mprime</code> had been installed onto the machine a few weeks back by
        the analyst, and consisted of a program which ran when the system was
        completely idle which had been written to find very large prime numbers
        called Mersenne primes.&nbsp; In the course of finding these numbers, the
        program also ran cross checks which high lighted any potential problems
        with the machine. Something which needed to be detected and isolated
        very
        quickly when dealing with a machine whose primary job was run computer
        programs used for simulations and analysis in the nuclear industry.
      </p>
      <p>Mersenne primes numbers were not only very long, but notoriously difficult
        to find.&nbsp;The program <code>mprime</code> had been written by a well respected computer scientist
        at Cray Research Inc in the USA called David Slowinski. Working with
        another computer scientist called Paul Gage, David ran an unofficial
        project in house at Cray to find large and large Mersenne Prime numbers,
        making use of small amounts of idle time on Cray supercomputers housed
        within the company, again with the upshot of being used to ensure that
        systems performed flawlessly.</p>
      <p>Some years earlier, the site analyst at Harwell lab remembered seeing
        a
        large red poster hung on a wall of a UK Cray Research facility. &nbsp;The
        poster contained an almost never ending number of digits, entitled the
        29th Mersenne prime.&nbsp; Although the analyst was familiar with large prime
        numbers and had spent time in the past producing fast computer programs
        in order to find large prime numbers, this relatively huge number looked
        absolutely incredible.&nbsp; Thus the analyst decided to contact the author
        of the program, David Slowinski in order to see if the program could
        run on the Cray-2 Supercomputer housed at Harwell.</p>
      <p>David Slowinski showing his usual enthusiasm for such things, happily
        obliged by providing the analyst with the program.&nbsp; The analyst
        spent the next week modifying the way in which the program was run in
        his spare time,
        eventually coming up with the finished article. In late January 1992,
        the
        program was set to work; starting up when the system was completely idle,
        then going into hibernation when users started up programs on the machine.</p>
      <p>On
        Monday 17th February, the analyst had noticed a strange entry in the
        <code>mprime</code> logfile.&nbsp; Before he could investigate further the phone rang.&nbsp;
        Immediately changing his attention to the nature of the call, the analyst
        completely forgot about the logfile entry; that was until just before
        the start of his software test slot on Wednesday.&nbsp; In a brief period
        just before the beginning of his test slot, the analyst decided to take
        another look at the logfile.&nbsp; The logfile contained reams and reams
        of entries, but near
        the end an entry '756839 prime' stood out. Surely it couldn't have been
        that easy to find a Mersenne prime the analyst thought.&nbsp; The previous
        Mersenne Prime number had been found back in 1985.&nbsp; This must be
        some kind of malfunction of the software or spoof entry.&nbsp; The analyst
        called into his office a couple of customer staff who were due to work
        with him that
        evening.&nbsp; As they peered at the screen, they appeared less skeptical
        about the find, and prompted the analyst to make a call to whomever
        had supplied the program.&nbsp; Cautiously the analyst rang David Slowinski
        at Cray
        in the USA, and told him about the entry.&nbsp; The entry actually referred
        to
        2 to the power 756839 being a prime number, something that was impossible
        to prove unless the Mersenne proving theorem was used.&nbsp; To the analyst's
        surprise David Slowinski actually responded with a &quot;well done&quot;,
        and that he would get back after the number had been verified.
      </p>
      <p>David Slowinski proceeded to use Cray's latest and greatest machine
        to verify the find; the brand new Cray C90 super computer, housed at
        Chippewa
        Falls in Cray's Wisconsin facility.&nbsp; It took 19 hours of cpu time
        for the
        Cray-2 supercomputer to test 2<sup>756839</sup>-1, but the same test ran in only
        just over 3 hours of the new 16 cpu Cray C90.&nbsp; Slowinski
        must have practically dedicated the C90 to the task as later on that
        evening, the analyst received an email to the effect that the number
        had indeed been verified on the C90. In the days that followed the new
        find was also verified by Richard Crandall, Chief Scientist at NEXT computer,
        as it was important to retest using a different computer architecture
        and software.</p>
      <p>On March 25th 1992, the new discovery was announced to the world by
        both Cray and Harwell Lab, and large amounts of press coverage followed;
        some
        good and some bad.&nbsp; The biggest problem was that although finding
        the new
        prime appeared to be a momentous, if not incomprehensible task, the fact
        that the number could not actually be used for anything, being just too
        big seemed to annoy many people.&nbsp; The press often forgot to mention that
        the program provided a critical role in ensuring machine integrity.&nbsp; The
        press coverable culminated in the UK TV show 'Tomorrows World' giving
        a slot to the find, where a presenter was seen running through a huge
        printout which was provided by the Cray analyst who discovered the number.</p>
      <p>The discovery was actually officially credited to Harwell Lab, as they
        owned
        the Cray-2 on which the number had been found.&nbsp; A little later that year
        David Slowinski actually visited the Harwell Site, which was seen as
        a good publicity exercise.&nbsp; Internally within Cray special badges were
        produced to commemorate the find, and Harwell commissioned their official
        photographer to take pictures of the site people who were involved.</p>
      <p>I do have photo's and press cuttings of the occasion, but I'm not sure
        that we can make the public on an internet site as I have lost contact
        with other
        people in the pictures.&nbsp; I've also just found the video from Tomorrows
        World TV show!</p>
