      <h2>Additional Comments </h2>
      <h3><a name="values"></a>Point Values </h3>
      <p>I have tried to place the highest penalties on those behaviors which most
        directly contradict the methods of mathematics.&nbsp; <b>In
          mathematics we seek to communicate and share.</b>&nbsp; This starts by studying
        the literature to see what others have done (first via the standard textbooks
        and texts, then by <a href="http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/search">MathSciNet</a>).&nbsp; Because
        of this study, we then know: the proper way (notation and context) with which
        to express our new discoveries; the key researchers in our area; and the proper
        journals for submitting our results.&nbsp; We
        learn the proper language for sharing, namely &quot;mathematical proof.&quot;&nbsp; Crackpots
        are those who seek to share without knowing the language they are speaking.&nbsp; They
        seek to join into a conversation without first listening to what the conversation
        is about. </p>
      <p>Mathematical communication then continues
        by listening.&nbsp; Mathematicians share their results as preprints and <a
          href="http://www.ams.org/meetings/">at
          meetings</a>so that others can see what they are doing and so that the authors
        might gain from the feedback.&nbsp; Mathematical
        disagreements and times arise but they are addressed in the time honored
        way: put up or shut up.&nbsp; That is, either present a proof of your position
        or admit it is just a guess (often called a conjecture or heuristics).&nbsp; Mathematical
        journals are refereed.&nbsp; Referees read to see if the mathematics is new,
        correct, and appropriately presented.&nbsp; They often ask questions and
        make suggestions that help authors improve their articles.&nbsp; Mathematics
        is a conversation, not a soliloquy.&nbsp; Crackpots are unable to listen,
        unable to join into this conversation.&nbsp; In fact most crackpots set themselves
        in direct opposition to the dialog of mathematics. </p>
      <h3><a name="establish"></a>Establishing Claim </h3>
      <p>How do mathematicians establish claim to their ideas?&nbsp; <a href="/notes/faq/publish.html">They
          publish</a>.&nbsp; Eventually
        in a journal, but usually first by e-mail, preprints and at mathematical conventions.&nbsp; Many
        mathematicians point out if you just read the journals, then you are already
        several years behind the key researchers.&nbsp; Most mathematicians have
        had ideas that they have failed to publish, and so when others published those
        ideas first, the others appropriately got the credit.&nbsp; Ironically, some
        crackpots keep their &quot;discovery&quot; secret.&nbsp; Should
        they (by some great stroke of luck) be correct, the crackpots own claim to
        the idea may be lost.&nbsp; In
        mathematics you establish your claim by sharing your proof (correctly, concisely,
        in the appropriate locations).&nbsp;</p>
      <h3><a name="but"></a>But what about... </h3>
      <p>Some of the behaviors attributed to crackpots are also present in the elder
        statesmen of mathematics.&nbsp; For example, Paul Erd&ouml;s famously offered
        prizes for proofs (and disproofs) of those things he thought true.&nbsp; Before
        his death he paid on many of these offers (and others maintain a fund to
        continue to pay on most of his offers).&nbsp; But Erd&ouml;s' mathematical
        saneness is well established by the 1500+ papers he wrote or coauthored.&nbsp; Indeed
        it is these articles that established his right to offer prizes.</p>
      <p>Another excellent example is Andre Wiles who proved Fermat's Last Theorem
        (FLT).&nbsp; Even
        though Wiles was exceptionally well established as a mathematician, he hesitated
        to state publicly what he was working on.&nbsp; Not because he thought his
        work might be stolen, but because merely claiming to have proven something
        thousands of the best minds in history have failed at, brings your work under
        grave suspicion.&nbsp; So
        what did he do?&nbsp; What all mathematicians do: he shared his ideas!&nbsp; First
        he shared with a colleague in a course at his school.&nbsp; Then with hundreds
        of colleagues at a mathematical meeting.&nbsp; Only
        at the end of that meeting did he actually make his claim.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; First,
        because his work was important whether or not it could be used to prove FLT.&nbsp; But
        perhaps more importantly to allow errors in his work to be pointed out before
        making a grandiose claim as FLT.<br>
        <br>
        Wiles then sent out his preprints and submitted to a journal.&nbsp; His work
        was circulated on the Internet.&nbsp; And as would be expected in a work of
        this size, errors were found.&nbsp; Most
        were trivial and immediately fixed, but one stopped the proof dead in its
        tracks.&nbsp; Eventually,
        with the help of another mathematician, Wiles circumvented the major error,
        and the proof was published.&nbsp; His work will be continue to be questioned,
        examined, modified (and even doubted) for many years, but it is out there for
        all to see.&nbsp; Mathematicians publish.
