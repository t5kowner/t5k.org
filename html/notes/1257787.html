            alt="Slowinski, Cray T94, Gage" width="173" height="220" align="right"></a>On <b>3 September
          1996</b>, <a href="http://www.cray.com/">Cray Research</a> announced that
        once again <a href="/bios/page.php?lastname=Slowinski">Slowinski</a> and <a
          href="/bios/page.php?lastname=Gage">Gage </a>have set a new record by
        finding the prime <b>2^1257787-1</b> which has 378,632 digits. This is
        the largest known prime by far--the next largest has "only" 258,716 digits.
        It is also the <a href="/mersenne/index.html#known">34th Mersenne</a> prime to be discovered (though it might
        not be the 34th in order of size
        as the entire region below it has not been checked). <a href="by_year.html#graph1">Looking
          at the graph</a> of the largest known prime by year, we see this prime
        is roughly the size record we'd expect to find this year.
      <p>The proof of this 378,632 digit number's primality (using the traditional
        <a href="/prove/prove3_2.html#test">Lucas-Lehmer test</a>) took about
        6 hours on one CPU of a CRAY T94 super computer. Richard Crandall and
        others independently verified the primality. <a name="Woltman">The first
          and</a> the most interesting of these was George Woltman who was 90% of
        the way through <i>that very number</i> when asked to check the result
        on April 15th. According to the San Jose Mercury News
        <span title="dead link http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/">article</span>
        he said "It hurt for a few days, but I got over it."
        <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm">Woltman's program</a> is available over
        the Internet and will check this new prime in about 60 hours on a 90MHz
        Pentium.
      <p>Finally, 16*1257787+1 divides (2^1257787+1)/3, so again the "<a href="/mersenne/index.html#bsw">new
          mersenne prime conjecture</a>" satisfied.</p>

      <h3 align="center"><a name="release"> LARGEST KNOWN PRIME NUMBER DISCOVERED
          ON CRAY RESEARCH SUPERCOMPUTER</a></h3>
      <font color="red">[Notes in brackets added by Chris. These errors were <u>not</u>
        caused by Slowinski and Gage; they are solely the creation of the public
        relations folk at SGI.]</font>
      <p>Employees of New Combined Silicon Graphics, Cray Responsible For Nearly
        All <font color="red">[Mersenne]</font> Prime Discoveries in Last 20 Years</p>
      <p>EAGAN, Minn., September 3, 1996 -- Computer scientists at Cray Research
        have discovered the largest-known prime number while conducting tests
        on a CRAY T94 system, one of the company's latest supercomputers, at its
        Wisconsin engineering and manufacturing operation in Chippewa Falls.
      <p>The new prime number is the 34th <font color="red">[Mersenne]</font> discovered
        and has 378,632 digits. Printed in newspaper-sized type, the number would
        fill approximately 12 newspaper pages. </p>
      <p>The largest Mersenne prime previously known was discovered in January
        1994 also at Cray Research's Wisconsin operation by the same computer
        scientists once again conducting rigorous quality tests of a Cray supercomputer.
        That prime number had 258,716 digits.</p>
      <p>Cray officials said that seven of the last eight Mersenne prime discoveries
        were run on Cray Research supercomputers. According to Cray, which recently
        merged with Silicon Graphics, Inc., Mountain View, Calif., all but one
        of the Mersenne prime number discoveries over the past 20 years were lead
        by Silicon Graphics or Cray employees <font color="red">[but not necessarily
          employees at the time of the discovery: <a href="/bios/page.php?lastname=Noll">Curt
            Noll</a> who <i>now</i> works for Silicon Graphics, was a high school
          student using a CDC Cyber 174 computer at the time of
          <a href="/bios/includes/nollnote.php">his
            discoveries</a>]
        </font>. </p>
      <h3>A Prime Lesson</h3>
      In mathematical notation, the new prime number is expressed as 2^1257787-1,
      which denotes two, multiplied by itself 1,257,787 times, minus one <font color="red">[actually
        1257786 times, minus one]</font>. Numbers expressed in this form are called
      "Mersenne" prime numbers after Father Marin Mersenne, a 17th century French
      monk who spent years searching for prime numbers of this type. </p>
      <p>Prime numbers can be divided evenly only by themselves and one. Examples
        include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and so on. The Greek mathematician Euclid proved
        that there are an infinite number of prime numbers. But these numbers
        do not occur in a regular sequence and there is no <font color="red">[<a href="faq/p_n.html">useful</a>]</font>
        formula for generating them. Therefore, the discovery of new <font color="red">[Mersenne]</font>
        primes requires randomly <font color="red">[??]</font> generating and testing
        millions <font color="red">[tens of thousands]</font> of numbers.</p>
      <p>"Finding these special numbers is a true 'needle-in-a-haystack' exercise,
        but we improve our odds by using tremendously fast computers and a clever
        program," said David Slowinski, a Cray Research computer scientist. Slowinski
        and fellow Cray Research computer scientist Paul Gage developed the program
        that found the new prime number. Mathematician Richard Crandall, Ph.D.,
        <font color="red">[and George Woltman]</font> independently verified the
        Cray team's prime number discovery.
      </p>
      <h3>Practical Applications Of Prime Numbers</h3>
      Prime numbers have applications in cryptography and computer systems security.
      Huge prime numbers like those discovered most recently are principally mathematical
      curiosities, but the process of searching for prime numbers does have several
      practical benefits. </p>
      <p>For instance, the "prime finder" program developed by Slowinski and Gage
        is used by Cray Research as a quality assurance test on all new supercomputer
        systems. A core element of this program is a routine that involves squaring
        a number repeatedly. As this process continues, it eventually involves
        multiplying immense numbers -- numbers of hundreds of thousands of digits
        -- by themselves. </p>
      <p>"This acts as a real 'torture test' for a computer," said Slowinski.
        "The prime finder program rigorously tests all elements of a system --
        from the logic of the processors, to the memory, the compiler and the
        operating and multitasking systems. For high performance systems with
        multiple processors, this is an excellent test of the system's ability
        to keep track of where all the data is." </p>
      <p>Slowinski said the recent CRAY T94 system test in which the new prime
        number was discovered ran for over 6 hours on one central processing unit
        of the system. "If a machine can complete this exhaustive run-through,
        we can be confident everything is working as it should," said Slowinski.</p>
      <p>In addition, Slowinski said, techniques used to speed up the performance
        of the prime finder can also be used to enhance the performance of programs
        customers use on real-world problems such as forecasting the weather and
        searching for oil. </p>
      <p>"Through our work on the prime finder program, we learn new techniques
        for speeding up certain kinds of mathematical operations. These operations
        are often key elements of the most computation-intensive portions of software
        programs our customers run routinely on their Cray systems," said Slowinski.</p>
      <h3>With Prime Comes Perfect</h3>
      <p>
        <font color="red">[The new <a href="/mersenne/index.html#theorems">perfect
            number</a> is 2^1257786*(2^1257787-1) which has 757,263 digits]</font>
      </p>
      <p>Slowinski noted that with the discovery of the new prime number, a new
        "perfect" number can also be generated. A perfect number is equal to the
        sum of its factors. For example, 6 is perfect because its factors -- 1,
        2 and 3 -- when added together, equal 6. Mathematicians don't know how
        many perfect numbers exist. They do know, however, that all <font color="red">[<a
            href="/mersenne/index.html#unknown">even</a>]</font> perfect numbers
        have a direct relationship to Mersenne primes. </p>

        most challenging problems. </p>
