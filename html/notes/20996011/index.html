      <p>ORLANDO, Florida - December 2, 2003 -- Michael Shafer, a 26 year-old
        volunteer in the <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm">Mersenne.org</a>research project called the <a
          href="http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm">Great
          Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS)</a>, has discovered the largest known
        prime number. Shafer used a Michigan State University lab PC and free software
        by George Woltman and Scott Kurowski as part of an international grid of 211,000
        networked computers in virtually every time zone of the world.</p>
      <p>The new number, expressed as 2 to the 20,996,011th power minus 1, has <a
          href="http://www.mersenne.org/prime6.txt">6,320,430 decimal digits</a>and was
        discovered November 17th. It is more than two million digits larger than the
        previous largest known prime number, and belongs to a special class of rare
        prime numbers called <a href="/mersenne/">Mersenne primes</a>.
        The discovery marks only the 40th known Mersenne prime, named after <a
          href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Mersenne.html">Marin
          Mersenne</a>, a 17th century French monk who first studied the numbers 300
        years ago.</p>
      <p>Mersenne primes are most relevant to number theory, but most participants
        join GIMPS simply for the fun of having a role in real research - and the chance
        of finding a new Mersenne prime. The new prime is 63% of the qualifying size for
        the $100,000 <a href="http://www.eff.org/awards/coop.php">Electronic Frontier
          Foundation</a>award for the first 10-million-digit prime, also being sought by
        the project's volunteers. In May 2000, a previous participant won the
        foundation's $50,000 award for discovering the first million-digit prime.</p>
      <p>Shafer, a chemical engineering graduate student at Michigan State University,
        described the find.&nbsp; "I had just finished a meeting with my advisor
        when&nbsp;I saw the computer had found the new prime.&nbsp; After a short
        victory dance, I called up my wife and friends involved with GIMPS to share the
        great news!"&nbsp; He used a 2 GHz Pentium 4 Dell Dimension PC running for 19
        days to prove the number prime. "The software runs great without affecting the
        computer.&nbsp; I get my work done and contribute to the project at the same
        time."</p>
      <p>Now in its eighth year, GIMPS has accomplished what no other distributed
        computing project has: Six consecutive successes. "Great teamwork has paid off
        for us again," said GIMPS founder George Woltman. "In addition to congratulating
        Michael Shafer, we wish to thank all 60,000 volunteer home users, students,
        schools, universities and businesses from around the world that contributed to
        this discovery." Woltman adds, "Joining GIMPS is a great way to learn about math
        through participation - and you might find a new Mersenne prime, like
        Michael."</p>
      <p>"PrimeNet organizes a vast computing resource for GIMPS. It's humbling to see
        so many people of varied lands, ages and vocations volunteering for this fun and
        amazing project," said Entropia founder,
        Scott Kurowski. Kurowski developed the <a href="http://mersenne.org/primenet">PrimeNet</a>system that runs GIMPS
        using
        his company's technology to demonstrate its scalability and power with a
        demanding distributed search application. PrimeNet pulls together hundreds of
        thousands of computers in parallel to create a virtual supercomputer running at
        9 trillion calculations per second, or 'teraflops'. This enabled GIMPS to find
        the prime in just two years instead of the 25,000 years a single PC would have
        required.</p>
      <p>The new prime was independently verified by Guillermo Ballester Valor of
        Granada, Spain using twelve days of time on a 1.4GHz quad Itanium II server at
        the HP Test Drive center, and by Ernst
        Mayer of Cupertino, California using three weeks of time on a 1 GHz HP Alpha
        workstation. The discovery is the sixth record prime found by the GIMPS project,
        and the fourth discovered using distributed computing software from Entropia,
        Inc. In recognition of every GIMPS contributor's effort, credit for this new
        discovery will go to "Shafer, Woltman, Kurowski, et al".</p>
      <p>"There are more primes out there," invites Woltman, "and anyone with an
        Internet-connected computer can participate." All the necessary software can be
        downloaded for free at <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm">http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm</a>.
        The calculations work by using spare background time that would otherwise be
        wasted. Please get permission to install the software on computers you do not
        own.</p>
      <p>The mathematical algorithm Woltman uses for GIMPS, called the IBDWT
        (irrational-base discrete weighted transform), was discovered by Apple
        Distinguished Scientist <a href="http://www.perfsci.com/">Dr. Richard
          Crandall</a>, director of the Center for Advanced Computation at Reed College,
        Portland, Oregon. A framed or unframed
        poster (and optional magnifying
        glass) displaying the multi-million-digit prime number is available from
        Perfectly Scientific, Inc. (<a href="http://www.perfsci.com/">http://www.perfsci.com/</a>). The IBDWT and
        related algorithms are available in the book, "<a
          href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0387947779/qid=1070259122/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-5922531-3340634?v=glance&amp;s=books"><EM>Prime
            Numbers: A Computational Perspective</EM></a>," by R. Crandall and C.
        Pomerance.</p>
      <p>Michael and his wife Liz Shafer live in Lansing, Michigan. He joined GIMPS in
        November 2000. George Woltman is a retired computer programmer living in
        Orlando, Florida. A life-long number theory enthusiast, he founded the Great
        Internet Mersenne Prime Search in 1996. Scott Kurowski is a software
        technologist and entrepreneur in San Diego, California. A GIMPS member since
        1996, he built PrimeNet and founded Entropia, Inc. in 1997.</p>
      <p><strong>About Mersenne.org's Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search</strong>
      </p>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm">Great Internet Mersenne Prime
          Search (GIMPS)</a>was formed in January 1996 by George Woltman to discover new
        world-record-size Mersenne primes. GIMPS harnesses the power of hundreds of
        thousands of small computers like yours to search for these "needles in a
        haystack". Most GIMPS members join the search for the thrill of possibly
        discovering a record-setting, rare, and historic new Mersenne prime. The search
        for more Mersenne primes is already under way. There may be smaller, as yet
        undiscovered Mersenne primes, but there are certainly larger Mersenne primes
        waiting to be discovered. Anyone with a reasonably powerful PC can join GIMPS
        and become a big prime hunter. All the necessary software can be downloaded for
        free at <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm">http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm</a>.
        GIMPS is based in Orlando, Florida. Additional pubic information may be found at

      <p><strong>For More Information on Mersenne Primes</strong> </p>
      <p>Previous GIMPS Mersenne prime discoveries were made by members in various
        countries. In November 2001, Michael Cameron discovered the <a
          href="http://www.mersenne.org/13466917.htm">previous largest known prime
          number</a>in Canada. In June 1999, Nayan Hajratwala discovered the <a
          href="http://www.mersenne.org/6972593.htm">38th Mersenne prime</a>in the U.S.
        In January 1998, Roland Clarkson discovered the <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/3021377.htm">37th Mersenne
          prime</a>in the U.S.
        Gordon Spence discovered the <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/2976221.htm">36th
          Mersenne prime</a>in August, 1997, in the U.K. Joel Armengaud discovered the <a
          href="http://www.mersenne.org/1398269.htm">35th Mersenne prime</a>in November,
        1996, in France.</p>
      <p>Prime numbers have long fascinated amateur and professional mathematicians.
        An integer greater than one is called a prime number if its only divisors are
        one and itself. The first prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. For example,
        the number 10 is not prime because it is divisible by 2 and 5. A Mersenne prime
        is a prime of the form 2<sup>P</sup>-1. The first Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31,
        127, etc. There are only 40 known Mersenne primes.</p>
      <p>An integer greater than one is called a prime number if its only positive
        divisors are one and itself. For example, the number 10 is not prime because it
        is divisible by 2 and 5. A Mersenne prime is a prime of the form
        2<sup>P</sup>-1. <a href="/mersenne/">Mersenne primes</a> have been central to number theory since they were
        first discussed by Euclid in
        350 BC. The man whose name they now bear, the French monk <a
          href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Mersenne.html"> Marin
          Mersenne</a>(1588-1648), made a famous conjecture on which values of p would
        yield a prime. It took 300 years and several important discoveries in
        mathematics to settle his conjecture. </p>
      <p>There is a unique history to the arithmetic algorithms underlying the GIMPS
        project. The programs that found the recent big Mersenne finds are based on a
        special algorithm. In the early 1990's, <a href="http://www.perfsci.com/">Richard Crandall</a>, Apple
        Distinguished
        Scientist, discovered ways to double the speed of what are called convolutions
        -- essentially big multiplication operations. The method is applicable not only
        to prime searching but other aspects of computation. During that work he also
        patented the Fast Elliptic Encryption system, now owned by Apple Computer, which
        uses Mersenne primes to quickly encrypt and decrypt messages. George Woltman
        implemented Crandall's algorithm in machine language, thereby producing a
        prime-search program of unprecedented efficiency, and that work led to the
        successful GIMPS project.</p>
      <p>Several hundred school teachers elementary through high-school grades have
        used GIMPS to get their students excited about mathematics. Students who run the
        free software are contributing to mathematical research. </p>
      <p>Historically, searching for Mersenne primes has been used as a test for
        computer hardware. The free GIMPS program used by Shafer has identified hidden
        hardware problems in many PCs.</p>
