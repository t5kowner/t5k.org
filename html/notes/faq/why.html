      <p>"Why?" we are often asked, "why would anyone want to find a prime that
        big?""&nbsp; I often now answer with "did you ever collect anything?""
        or "did you ever try to win a competition?"" Much of the answer for why
        we collect large primes is the same as why we might collect other rare
        items. Below I will present a more complete answer divided into several
        parts.</p>

        <li> <a href="#products">For the by-products of the quest</a></li>

        <li><a href="#money">For the money?</a></li>
      </ol>

      <p>This does not exhaust the list of reasons, for example some might be motivated
        by primary research or a need for publication. Many others just hate to
        see a good machine wasting cycles (sitting idle or running an inane screen
        saver). </p>

      <p>Perhaps these arguments will not convince you.&nbsp; If not, just recall
        that the eye may not see what the ear hears, but that does not reduce
        the value of sound.&nbsp; There are always melodies beyond our grasp.
        (<a href="../../programs/music/index.html">*</a>)</p>

      <h3><a name="tradition"></a>1. Tradition!</h3>

      <p>Euclid may have been the first to define primality in his Elements approximately
        300 BC. His goal was to characterize the <a href="/mersenne/index.html#theorems">even perfect
          numbers</a>(numbers like
        6 and 28 which are equal to the sum of their aliquot divisors: 6 = 1+2+3,
        28=1+2+4+7+14). He realized that the even perfect numbers (<a href="/mersenne/index.html#unknown">no odd perfect
          numbers are known</a>)
        are all closely related to the primes of the form 2<sup><i>p</i></sup>-1
        for some prime <i>p</i> (now called Mersennes). So the quest for these jewels
        began near 300 BC. </p>

      <p><a href="../../largest.html">Large primes</a>(especially of this form)
        were then studied (in chronological order) by Cataldi, Descartes, Fermat,
        Mersenne, Frenicle, Leibniz, Euler, Landry, Lucas, Catalan, Sylvester,
        Cunningham, Pepin, Putnam and Lehmer (to name a few).&nbsp; How can we
        resist joining such an illustrious group? </p>

      <p>Much of elementary number theory was developed while deciding how to
        handle large numbers, how to characterize their factors and discover those
        which are prime.&nbsp; (Look, for example, at the concepts required to
        develop simple proofs such as [<a href="../proofs/MerDiv.html">1</a>] or [<a
          href="../proofs/MerDiv2.html">2</a>].) In short, the tradition of seeking large
        primes (especially the Mersennes) has been long and fruitful It is a tradition
        well worth continuing. </p>

      <h3><a name="products"></a>2. For the by-products of the quest</h3>

      <p>Being the first to put a man on the moon had great political value for the
        United States of America, but what was perhaps of the most lasting value
        to the society was the by-products of the race.&nbsp; By-products such as
        the new technologies and materials that were developed for the race that
        are now common everyday items, and the improvements to education's infrastructure
        that led many man and women into productive lives as scientists and engineers. </p>

      <p>The same is true for the quest for record primes.&nbsp; In the tradition
        section above I listed some of the giants who were in the search (such
        as Euclid, Euler and Fermat).&nbsp; They left in their wake some of the
        greatest theorems of elementary number theory (such as <a href="../proofs/FermatsLittleTheorem.html">Fermat''s
          little theorem</a>and quadratic
        reciprocity).&nbsp; </p>

      <p>More recently, the search has demanded new and faster ways of multiplying
        large integers.&nbsp; In 1968 Strassen discovered how to multiply quickly
        using Fast Fourier
        Transforms. He and Sch&ouml;nhage refined and published the method
        in 1971. GIMPS now uses an improved version of their algorithm developed
        by the long time Mersenne searcher <a href="/bios/page.php?lastname=Crandall">Richard Crandall</a>[see <a
          href="../../references/refs.cgi/CF94">CF94</a>]. </p>

      <p>The Mersenne search is also used by school teachers to involve their
        students in mathematical research, and perhaps to excite them into careers
        in science or engineering. And these are just a few of the by-products
        of the search. </p>

      <h3><a name="collect"></a>3. People collect rare and beautiful items</h3>

      Mersenne primes, which are usually the largest known primes, are both rare
      and beautiful.&nbsp; Since Euclid initiated the search for and study of
      Mersennes approximately 300 BC, very few have been found.&nbsp; Less than fifty
      in all of human history--that is rare! </p>

      <p>But they are also beautiful.&nbsp; Mathematics, like all fields of study,
        has a definite notion of beauty.&nbsp; What qualities are perceived as
        beautiful in mathematics?&nbsp; We look for&nbsp; proofs that&nbsp; are
        short, concise, clear, and if possible that combine previous disparate
        concepts or teach you something new.&nbsp; Mersennes have one of the simplest
        possible forms for primes, 2<sup><i>n</i></sup>-1.&nbsp; The proof of
        their primality has an elegant simplicity.&nbsp; Mersennes are beautiful
        and have some surprising applications. </p>

      <h3><a name="glory"></a>4. For the glory!</h3>

      <p>Why do athletes try to run faster than anyone else, jump higher, throw a
        javelin further?&nbsp; Is it because they use the skills of javelin throwing
        in their jobs?&nbsp; Not likely.&nbsp; More probably it is the desire to
        compete (and to win!) </p>

      <p>This desire to compete is not always directed against other humans.&nbsp;
        Rock climbers may see a cliff as a challenge. Mountain climbers can not
        resist certain mountains. </p>

      <p>Look at the incredible size of these giant primes!&nbsp; Those who found
        them are like the athletes in that they outran their competition. They
        are like the mountain climbers in that they have scaled to new heights.&nbsp;
        Their greatest contribution to mankind is not merely pragmatic, it is
        to the curiosity and spirit of man.&nbsp; If we lose the desire to do
        better, will we still be complete? </p>

      <h3><a name="test_hardware"></a>5. To test the hardware</h3>

      <blockquote class="blockquote"><i> (This one has historically been used as an argument to get
          the computer time, so it is often a motivation for the company rather
          than the individual) </i></blockquote>

      <p>Since the dawn of electronic computing, programs for finding primes have
        been used as a test of the hardware.&nbsp; For example, software routines
        from the GIMPS project were used by Intel to test Pentium II and Pentium
        Pro chips before they were shipped.&nbsp; So a great many of the readers
        of this page have <i>directly</i> benefited from the search for Mersennes.</p>

      <p>Slowinski, who has help find more Mersennes than any other, works for
        Cray Research and they use his program as a hardware test. The infamous
        Pentium bug was found in a related effort as <a href="http://www.trnicely.net/index.html">Thomas
          Nicely</a>was calculating the <a class="glossary" title="glossary"
          href="/glossary/page.php?sort=TwinPrimeConstant">twin
          prime
          constant</a>. </p>

      <p>Why are prime programs used this way?&nbsp; They are intensely CPU and
        bus bound.&nbsp; They are relatively short, give an easily checked answer
        (when run on a known prime they should output true after their billions
        of calculations).&nbsp; They can easily be run in the background while
        other "more important" tasks run, and they are usually easy to stop and
        restart.</p>

      <h3><a name="primary_research"></a>6. To learn more about their distribution</h3>

      <p>Though mathematics is not an experimental science, we often look for examples
        to test conjectures (which we hope to then prove). As the number of examples
        increase, so does (in a sense) our understanding of the distribution. The
        <a class="glossary" title="glossary" href="/glossary/page.php?sort=PrimeNumberThm">prime
          number theorem</a>was discovered by looking at tables of primes.
      </p>
      <p>Simple calculations have found patterns, such as the prime number races, which have led to significant amounts
        of research.</p>

      <h3><a name="money"></a>7. For the money?</h3>

      <p>There are a few who seek primes just for the money. There are prizes for the first prover ten-million digit
        prime ($100000), the first hundred-million digit prime ($150000), and the first billion digit prime ($250000).
