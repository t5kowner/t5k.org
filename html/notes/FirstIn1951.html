      <h2>The Problem: </h2>

      <p>For seventy five years Lucas' Mersenne:
        M<sub>127</sub> = 2<sup>127</sup>-1 held the record for the largest known
        prime.&nbsp; In 1951 Miller and Wheeler beat this by finding a series
        of primes <i>k</i>*M<sub>127</sub>+1, then 180(2<sup>127</sup>-1)<sup>2</sup> +
        1.&nbsp; The same year Ferrier
        announced (2<sup>148</sup>+1)/17.&nbsp; So which came first?&nbsp; This
        web page addresses just this one point of contention as a supplement
        to our document: <a href="by_year.html">The
          Largest Known Prime by Year</a>.</p>

      <h2>Answer One: I don't know.</h2>

      <p>In the journal Nature, Miller and Wheeler [<a href="/references/refs.cgi/MW51">MW51</a>] wrote the following
        (this is the complete text of the article):</p>

      <div class="w-75 ml-5 p-4 indigo lighten-5">
        <p class="text-center font-weight-bolder m-3">Large Prime Numbers</p>
        <p>For about seventy-five years the largest known
          prime number has been <i>P</i> = 2<sup>127</sup> - 1,
          identified as such by Edouard Lucas. It has remained the largest
          known in spite of many attempts to identify larger
          ones, although there have been conjectures and claims
          insufficiently substantiated or entirely unproved.</p>

        <p>Recently we have prepared a routine for testing on the
          EDSAC the primality of numbers of the form <i>k P</i> + 1, with <i>P</i> as
          defined above, and have found ten values of <i>k</i> that give prime numbers.
          The largest of these gives the present (June 7) largest known prime, namely,</p>

        <p class="pl-4">934(2<sup>127</sup> - 1) + 1 </p>
        <p class="py-1 text-right">J. C. P. Miller<br>
          D. J. Wheeler</p>
        <p>June 7.</p>
        <p><i>Note added in proof (October 8)</i>. Further work on
          the EDSAC by Wheeler and myself has demonstrated the primality of
        <p class="pl-5"> 978(2<sup>127</sup> - 1) + 1</p>
        <p>and culminated in early July in the identification of the
          present largest known prime,</p>
        <div class="pl-5 py-1">180(2<sup>127</sup> - 1 )<sup>2</sup> + 1.</div>
        Also,
        in early July, A. Ferrier, of France, using a desk machine, demonstrated the
        primality of
        <div class="pl-5 py-2">(2<sup>148</sup> + 1)/17,</div>
        which is the second largest known prime.
        <div class="py-2 text-right">J. C. P. Miller <br>
          University Mathematical Laboratory, Cambridge.</div>
      </div>


      <p class="mt-4">This can be read in many ways.&nbsp; If Miller &amp; Wheeler knew of Ferrier's
        work in June, this would seem to imply Ferrier had not finished when they found
        their first sequence of primes, but even so, it does not order the two &quot;early
        July primes.&quot;&nbsp; So possibly Miller &amp; Wheeler had a sequence of records
        sized primes beginning in June:
      <div class="pl-5 py-1"><i>k</i><sup>.</sup>M<sub>127</sub> + 1 for <i>k</i> = 114, 124, 388, 408,
        498, 696, 738, 774, 780, 934 and 978; </div>
      and ending with 180(2<sup>127</sup>-1 )<sup>2</sup> +
      1.&nbsp; In this case Ferrier's (2<sup>148</sup>+1)/17 never held the record
      for the largest known prime.
      </p>
      <p>We can at least be confident Miller &amp; Wheeler were not <i>aware</i> of Ferrier's discovery when they found
        180(2<sup>127</sup>-1 )<sup>2</sup> + 1. In the <i>Eureka</i> journal, Miller [<a
          href="/references/refs.cgi/Miller51">Miller51</a>] noted in an addendum:</p>
      <div class="w-75 ml-5 p-4 indigo lighten-5">
        Since the above note was written, I have heard in a letter from A. Ferrier (France) that he has identified as
        prime the number (2<sup>148</sup> + 1)/17
      </div>
      </br>
      <p>Since there is still the possibility Ferrier's prime was found first and Miller &amp; Wheeler simply weren't
        aware of it yet,
        I (Chris Caldwell) checked with a family member, David Miller, who responded [e-mail, 4 April
        1997]:</p>
      <blockquote class="blockquote"> I do not know which was first.&nbsp; I have just checked some notes of
        J. C. P. Miller in which he states &quot;until the 8th was found to be prime
        in July.&quot; and &quot;during
        the period of May to July A. Ferrier was applying similar tests to (2<sup>148</sup>+1)/17,
        using a desk machine.&nbsp; His results show this to be prime, the second
        largest prime number known.&quot;&nbsp; The notes are undated so I cannot
        deduce which was first.&nbsp; My failing memory recalls that Jeff Miller,
        went to some length to make sure Ferrier's result was
        not overlooked.&nbsp; So I would guess that the 180 was first with a probability
        of about 2/3rds. </blockquote>
      <p>Undated... darn.&nbsp; So what do we know of Ferrier's dates?&nbsp; We
        definitely know he had completed his work by July 14, but as Hans Riesel
        suggest, he may have been done earlier [e-mail, 26 March 1997]: </p>
      <blockquote class="blockquote"> I saw your &quot;history question&quot; on the largest prime, established
        without computers.&nbsp; In MTAC, the forerunner to Math. Comp, vol.
        6 (1952). p. 256, Ferrier reports on his work on (2<sup>148</sup>+1)/17.&nbsp; There
        is an editorial remark, stating that Ferrier's letter to MTAC is dated
        July 14, 1951.&nbsp; So
        at least at that date Ferrier had completed his primality proof for
        this number.<br>
        <br>
        (Perhaps Ferrier already had it for some time, and as a good Frenchman
        saved its announcement to the French national holiday, but this is
        just a guess on my part.)&nbsp; A description of Ferrier's work on this
        number can be found in my book, on pp. 122-123.&nbsp; So, if you cannot
        find a more precise date for Wheeler's and Miller's work, it will be
        difficult to tell, which number came first.
      </blockquote>
      <p>If indeed he had waited for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastille_Day">Bastille
          Day</a>, July 14th, he surely would
        not have waited too long.&nbsp; The one page excerpt of Ferrier's letter
        in MTAC is a very nice summary, but gives no hint on timing.&nbsp; It
        should not have taken months, so if he had been working on it in May,
        he <i>could</i> have
        completed before July.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Just like with today's prime records,
        it is not the test of the final number that takes so long--it is finding
        the right number to test!)</p>
      <p> It is intriguing to me that D. H. Lehmer listed Ferrier first when
        summarizing &quot;recent discoveries&quot; (given in its entirety) [MTAC,
        Vol. 5, No. 36, Oct., 1951] : </p>
      <blockquote class="blockquote"> 131. Recent Discoveries of Large Primes. Ever since Lucas announced
        the discovery of the prime 2<sup>127</sup>-1 in 1786, many attempts
        have been made to discover larger primes.&nbsp; These attempts have
        succeeded only recently as follows:<br>
        <br>
        (a) A. Ferrier1 has identified (2<sup>148</sup>+1)/17 as prime, using
        a method based on the converse of Fermat's theorem and a desk calculator.<br>
        <br>
        (b) Using the same method and the EDASC, Wheeler and Miller2,3 have
        proved the primality of 1+<i>k</i>(2<sup>127</sup> - 1) for <i>k</i> =
        114, 124, 388, 408, 498,696, 738, 744[sic], 780, 934, 978, and finally
        1+180<i></i>(2<sup>127</sup> - 1)<sup>2</sup>, a number of 79 decimal
        digits.<br>
        <br>
        (c) Using the standard Lucas test for Mersenne primes as programmed
        by R. M. Robinson, the SWAC has discovered the primes 2<sup>521</sup>-1
        and 2<sup>607</sup>-1 on January 30, 1952. These led to the 13th and
        14th perfect numbers.

      <p>Again, there is no statement that the order is chronological.</p>
      <h2>Answer Two: Maybe it Doesn't Matter</h2>
      <p>The two records are of very different type.&nbsp; Whichever was first,
        Ferrier's result stands as the largest known prime found manually.&nbsp; On
        the other hand, Miller and Wheeler's record lasted only a matter of months.</p>
      <p>On our page of the Largest Known Primes by Year, the two records stand
        in separate sections--Ferrier's at the end of the &quot;before computer&quot; primes
        and Miller and Wheeler began the computer era of discovery.&nbsp; Both
        records are important in their own right, and though I would be interested
        in knowing the exact dates of discovery (let me know if you have information!),
        I think we can rest for now with Lehmer's summary. </p>
