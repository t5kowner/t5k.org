        Largest Known Prime Number: 2<font size="4"><sup>74,207,281</sup></font>-1</h4>

      <p>RALEIGH, North Carolina -- On January 7th at 22:30 UTC, the Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS)
        celebrated its 20th anniversary with the
        math discovery of the new
        largest known prime number, 2<sup>74,207,281</sup>-1, having
        <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/primes/digits/M74207281.zip">22,338,618 digits</a>,
        on a university computer volunteered by Curtis Cooper for the project. The
        same GIMPS
        software just uncovered a
        <a
          href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/01/intel-skylake-bug-causes-pcs-to-freeze-during-complex-workloads/">flaw
          in Intel's latest Skylake CPUs</a><sup>[1]</sup>, and its global network of CPUs
        peaking at 450 trillion calculations per second remains the longest
        continuously-running &quot;grassroots supercomputing&quot;<sup>[2]</sup>
        project in Internet history.
      </p>

      <p>The new prime number, also known as M74207281, is calculated by multiplying
        together 74,207,281 twos then subtracting one. It is almost 5 million digits larger than
        the <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/primes/?press=M57885161">previous record prime number</a>,
        in a special class of extremely rare prime numbers known as Mersenne primes.
        It is only the 49th known Mersenne prime ever discovered, each increasingly
        difficult to find. Mersenne primes were named for the French monk
        <a href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Mersenne.html">Marin Mersenne</a>,
        who studied these numbers more than 350 years ago. GIMPS, founded in 1996, has discovered
        all 15 of the largest known Mersenne primes.
        Volunteers <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft.htm">download a free program </a>to search for these primes
        with a cash
        award offered to anyone lucky enough to compute a new prime.
        Prof. Chris Caldwell maintains an authoritative web site on
        <a href="http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/largest.html">the largest known primes</a> and is an excellent <a
          href="https://t5k.org/mersenne/index.html">history of Mersenne primes</a>.
      </p>


      <p>The primality proof took 31 days of non-stop computing on a PC with an Intel
        I7-4790 CPU.&nbsp; To prove there were no errors in the prime discovery process, the new prime was independently
        verified
        using both different software and hardware.
        Andreas Hoglund and David Stanfill each verified the prime using the <a
          href="http://www.mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=16142">CUDALucas </a>software running on NVidia Titan
        Black GPUs in 2.3 days. David Stanfill verified
        it using <a href="http://www.mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=18297">
          ClLucas</a> on an AMD Fury X GPU in 3.5 days. Serge Batalov also verified it
        using Ernst Mayer's MLucas software on two Intel Xeon 18-core Amazon EC2 servers in 3.5 days.</p>


      <p><a href="http://www.math-cs.ucmo.edu/~curtisc/primes.html">Dr. Cooper </a>is a professor at the <a
          href="http://ucmo.edu">University of Central Missouri</a>.
        This is the fourth record GIMPS project prime for Dr. Cooper and his university.
        The discovery is eligible for a $3,000 GIMPS research discovery award. Their
        first record prime was discovered in 2005, eclipsed by their second record in
        2006. Dr. Cooper lost the record in 2008, reclaimed it in 2013, and improves
        that record with this new prime. Dr. Cooper and the University of Central
        Missouri is the largest contributor of CPU time to the GIMPS project.</p>

      <p>Dr. Cooper's computer reported the prime in GIMPS on September 17, 2015 but
        it remained unnoticed
        until routine maintenance data-mined it. The official discovery date is
        the day a human took note of the result. This is in keeping with tradition as M4253 is
        considered <a href="https://t5k.org/notes/by_year.html">never to have been the largest known prime</a> number
        because Hurwitz in 1961 read
        his computer printout backwards and saw M4423 was prime seconds before seeing that M4253 was also prime.
      </p>

      <p>GIMPS Prime95 client software was developed by founder George Woltman.
        Scott Kurowski wrote the PrimeNet system software that coordinates GIMPS'
        computers.
        Aaron Blosser is now the system administrator, upgrading and maintaining PrimeNet as needed.
        Volunteers have a chance to earn <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/legal/#awards">research discovery awards of
          $3,000 or $50,000 </a>if their computer discovers a new Mersenne prime. GIMPS' next major goal is to win the
        <a href="http://www.eff.org/awards/coop-prime-info.php">$150,000 award
          administered by the Electronic Frontier Foundation </a>offered
        for finding a 100 million digit prime number.
      </p>

      <p>Credit for GIMPS' prime discoveries goes not only to Dr. Cooper for
        running the Prime95 software on his university's computers, Woltman, Kurowski, and Blosser for
        authoring the software and running the project, but also the thousands of
        GIMPS volunteers that sifted through millions of non-prime candidates.&nbsp;
        Therefore, official credit for this discovery shall go to &quot;C. Cooper, G. Woltman, S. Kurowski, A. Blosser,
        et al.&quot;</p>

      </p>

      <p>The <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/">Great Internet Mersenne
          Prime Search (GIMPS)</a> was formed in January 1996 by George Woltman to
        discover new world record size Mersenne primes. In 1997 Scott Kurowski enabled GIMPS
        to automatically harness the power of
        hundreds of thousands of ordinary computers to search for these "needles in a
        haystack". Most GIMPS members join the search for the thrill of possibly
        discovering a record-setting, rare, and historic new Mersenne prime.
        The search for more Mersenne primes is already under way. There may be
        smaller, as yet undiscovered Mersenne primes, and there almost certainly are larger
        Mersenne primes waiting to be found. Anyone with a reasonably powerful PC
        can join GIMPS and become a big prime hunter, and possibly earn a cash research
        discovery award. All the necessary software
        can be downloaded for free at <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft.htm">www.mersenne.org/freesoft.htm</a>.
        GIMPS is organized as Mersenne Research, Inc., a 501(c)(3) science research
        charity. Additional information may be found at

      <p><strong>For More Information on Mersenne Primes</strong></p>

      <p>Prime numbers have long fascinated amateur and professional mathematicians.
        An integer greater than one is called a prime number if its only divisors are
        one and itself. The first prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. For example,
        the number 10 is not prime because it is divisible by 2 and 5.
        A Mersenne prime is a prime number of the form 2<sup>P</sup>-1.
        The first Mersenne primes are 3, 7, 31, and 127 corresponding to
        P = 2, 3, 5, and 7 respectively. There are only 49 known Mersenne primes.</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/mersenne.html">Mersenne
          primes </a>have been central to number theory since they were first discussed by
        Euclid about 350 BC. The man whose name they now bear, the French monk <a
          href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Mersenne.html">Marin Mersenne
        </a>(1588-1648),
        made a famous conjecture on which values of P would
        yield a prime. It took 300 years and several important discoveries in
        mathematics to settle his conjecture.</p>

      <p>Previous GIMPS Mersenne prime discoveries were made by members
        in various countries.

        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In August 1997, Gordon Spence et al. discovered the <a
          href="http://www.mersenne.org/various/2976221.htm">36th Mersenne prime</a> in the U.K.

        <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In November 1996, Joel Armengaud et al. discovered the <a
          href="http://www.mersenne.org/various/1398269.htm">35th Mersenne prime </a>in France.
      </p>

      <p>Euclid proved that every Mersenne prime generates a perfect number. A perfect
        number is one whose proper divisors add up to the number itself. The smallest
        perfect number is 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 and the second perfect number is 28 = 1 + 2 + 4
        + 7 + 14. Euler (1707-1783) proved that all even perfect numbers come from
        Mersenne primes. The newly discovered perfect number is 2<sup>74,207,280</sup> x (2<sup>74,207,281</sup>-1).
        This
        number is over <a href="http://mersenne.org/primes/perfect/p74207281.zip">44 million digits</a> long!
        It is still unknown if any odd perfect numbers exist. </p>


      <p>There is a unique history to the arithmetic algorithms underlying the GIMPS
        project. The programs that found the recent big Mersenne finds are based on a
        special algorithm. In the early 1990's, the late
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Crandall">Richard Crandall</a>, Apple Distinguished
        Scientist, discovered ways to double the speed of what are called convolutions
        -- essentially big multiplication operations. The method is applicable not
        only to prime searching but other aspects of computation. During that work
        he also patented the Fast Elliptic Encryption system, now owned by
        Apple Computer, which uses Mersenne primes to quickly encrypt and decrypt
        messages. George Woltman implemented Crandall's algorithm in assembly
        language, thereby producing a prime-search program of unprecedented
        efficiency, and that work led to the successful GIMPS project.
      </p>

      <p>School teachers from elementary through high-school grades have used
        GIMPS to get their students excited about mathematics. Students who run the
        free software are contributing to mathematical research. David Stanfill's
        verification computation for this discovery was donated by
