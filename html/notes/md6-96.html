    <p>I am pleased to send you some new values of pi(x):
        ( 2e18 means 2.10^(18) and so on...)

    These values have been checked
    <ol>
        <li>by computing pi(x) and pi(x + 1e7) and checking that the number of primes in
            the short interval agrees with the two values of pi.
        <li>or
            by computing them two times with different values of 2 parameters
            y and z used during the computation.
    </ol>

    Thanks to Paul Zimmermann from INRIA Nancy who lend me some days of
    computation on his machines, (and also some hours of his time to
    compile the program on these machines!), and between other values got
    the pi(418....) = 10^17.

    <p>The method is presented in Math of Comp 1996 by
        Deleglise & Rivat: Computing Pi(x), the Meissel, Lehmer, Lagarias,
        Miller, Odlyzko method [<a href="/references/refs.cgi/DR96">DR96</a>].
        The program is an improved implementation of the precedent version.
        The asymptotic time and space complexity are unchanged (O(x^(2/3)/logx^2)
        for time and O(x^(1/3)logx^3) for space);

    <p>pi(1e19) took 40 hours of computation on a DEC-Alpha 5/250
        and needed about 80Mo memory.
        pi(1e20) took 13days of computation on a DEC-ALPHA 5/250
        (because of lack of memory, we had to exchange space against time)
        and also 13days on a R8000.
