Hi all,

	As the newspaper should announce the new prime on Monday or Tuesday,
I've placed the info on the new prime at http://www.mersenne.org/prime.htm
Congratulations to Nayan Hajratwala and all GIMPS members for our fourth
success!

	Each Mersenne announcement is different.  This time round I finally
figured out how to get the press interested in the new number - tell them
its a secret.  The Oregonian was doing an article on Richard Crandall and
when the found out there was a new prime and we wouldn't tell them what it
was, their interest level went way up!

	I admire the resourcefulness of GIMPS members for going on a 
"scavenger hunt" and finding out the exponent a few days before this
email was sent out.  However the resourcefulness award must go to one
enterprising GIMPS member that dug through all the cleared and assigned
exponent lists and human-readable files and deduced the exponent in early
June!  (Note to Scott - create a dummy non-zero residue a stick it
in the cleared exponents report).

	Good luck to all in the search for M39!	

Have fun,
George
